<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page507" id="page507"></a>507</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">MALTA,<a name="ar1" id="ar1"></a></span> the largest of the Maltese Islands, situated between
Europe and Africa, in the central channel which connects the
eastern and western basins of the Mediterranean Sea. The
group belongs to the British Empire. It extends over 29 m.,
and consists of Malta, 91 sq. m., Gozo (<i>q.v.</i>) 20 sq. m., Comino
(set apart as a quarantine station) 1 sq. m., and the uninhabited
rocks called Cominotto and Filfla. Malta (lat. of Valletta
Observatory 35° 53&prime; 55&Prime; N., long. 14° 30&prime; 45&Prime; W.) is about 60 m.
from the nearest point of Sicily, 140 m. from the mainland of
Europe and 180 from Africa; it has a magnificent natural
harbour. From the dawn of maritime trade its possession has
been important to the strongest nations on the sea for the time
being.</p>

<p>Malta is about 17½ m. long by 8¼ broad; Gozo is 8¾ by 4½ m.
This chain of islands stretches from N.E. to S.E. On the S.W. the
declivities towards the sea are steep, and in places rise abruptly
some 400 ft. from deep water. The general slope of these
ridges is towards the N.W., facing Sicily and snow-capped Etna,
the source of cool evening breezes. The Bingemma range,
rising 726 ft., is nearly at right angles to the axis of the main
island. The geological &ldquo;Great Fault&rdquo; stretches from sea to sea
at the foot of these hills. There are good anchorages in the
channels between Gozo and Comino, and between Comino and
Malta. In addition to the harbours of Valletta, there are in
Malta, facing N.W., the bays called Mellieha and St Paul&rsquo;s, the
inlets of the Salina, of Madalena, of St Julian and St Thomas;
on the S.E. there is the large bay of Marsa Scirocco. There
are landing places on the S.W. at Fomh-il-rih and Miggiarro.
Mount Sceberras (on which Valletta is built) is a precipitous
promontory about 1 m. long, pointing N.E. It rises out of deep
water; well-sheltered creeks indent the opposite shores on both
sides. The waters on the S.E. form the &ldquo;Grand Harbour,&rdquo;
having a narrow entrance between Ricasoli Point and Fort St
Elmo. The series of bays to the N.W., approached between the
points of Tigne and St Elmo, is known as the Marsamuscetto
(or Quarantine) Harbour.</p>

<p>Mighty fortifications and harbour works have assisted to
make this ideal situation an emporium of Mediterranean trade.
During the Napoleonic wars and the Crimean campaign the
Grand Harbour was frequently overcrowded with shipping.
The gradual supplanting of sail by steamships has made Malta
a coaling station of primary importance. But the tendency to
great length and size in modern vessels caused those responsible
for the civil administration towards the end of the 19th century
to realize that the harbour accommodation was becoming inadequate
for modern fleets and first-class liners. A breakwater was
therefore planned on the Monarch shoal, to double the available
anchorage area and increase the frontage of deep-water wharves
available in all weathers.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The Maltese Islands consist largely of Tertiary Limestone, with
somewhat variable beds of Crystalline Sandstone, Greensand and
Marl or Blue Clay. The series appears to be in line with
similar formations at Tripoli in Africa, Cagliari in
<span class="sidenote">Geology and Water Supply.</span>
Sardinia, and to the east of Marseilles. To the south-east
of the Great Fault (already mentioned) the beds
are more regular, comprising, in descending order, (<i>a</i>) Upper
Coralline Limestone; (<i>b</i>) Yellow, Black or Greensand; (<i>c</i>) Marl or
Blue Clay; (<i>d</i>) White, Grey and Pale Yellow Sandstone; (<i>e</i>) Chocolate-coloured
nodules with shells, &amp;c.; (<i>f</i>) Yellow Sandstone; (<i>g</i>)
Lower Crystalline Limestone. The Lower Limestone probably
belongs to the Tongarian stage of the Oligocene series, and the
Upper Coralline Limestone to the Tortonian stage of the Miocene.
The beds are not folded. The general dip of the strata is from
W.S.W. to E.N.E. North of the Great Fault and at Comino the
level of the beds is about 400 ft. lower, bringing (<i>c</i>), the Marl, in
juxtaposition with (<i>g</i>), the semi-crystalline Limestone. There is
a system of lesser faults, parallel to the Great Fault, dividing the
area into a number of blocks, some of which have fallen more than
others. There are also indications of another series of faults
roughly parallel to the south-east coast, which point to the islands
being fragments of a former extensive plateau. The mammalian
remains found in Pleistocene deposits are of exceptional interest.
Among the more remarkable forms are a species of hippopotamus,
the elephant (including a pigmy variety), and a gigantic dormouse.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page508" id="page508"></a>508</span>
In the Coralline Limestone the following fossils have been noted:&mdash;<i>Spondylus</i>,
<i>Ostrea</i>, <i>Pecten</i>, <i>Cytherea</i>, <i>Arca</i>, <i>Terebratula</i>, <i>Orthis</i>,
<i>Clavagella</i>, <i>Echinus</i>, <i>Cidaris</i>, <i>Nucleolites</i>, <i>Brissus</i>, <i>Spatangus</i>; in the
Marl the <i>Nautilus zigzag</i>; in the Yellow, Black and Greensand shells
of <i>Lenticulites complanatus</i>, teeth and vertebrae of <i>Squalidae</i> and
<i>Cetacea</i>; in the Sandstone <i>Vaginula depressa</i>, <i>Crystallaria</i>, <i>Nodosaria</i>,
<i>Brissus</i>, <i>Nucleolites</i>, <i>Pecten burdigallensis</i>, <i>Scalaria</i>, <i>Scutella subrotunda</i>,
<i>Spatangus</i>, <i>Nautilus</i>, <i>Ostrea navicularis</i> and <i>Pecten cristatus</i> (see
Captain Spratt&rsquo;s work and papers by Lord Ducie and Dr Adams).</p>

<p>The Blue Clay forms, at the higher levels, a stratum impervious
to water, and holds up the rainfall, which soaks through the spongy
mass of the superimposed coralline formations. Hence arise the
springs which run perennially, several of which have been collected
into the gravitation water supplies of the Vignacourt and Fawara
aqueducts. The larger part of the water supply, however, is now
derived by pumping from strata at about sea-level. These strata
are generally impregnated with salt water, and are practically
impenetrable to the rain-water of less weight. The honeycomb of
rock, and capillary action, retard the lighter fresh-water from
sinking to the sea; the soakage from rain has therefore to move
horizontally, over the strata about sea-level, seeking outlets. At
this stage the rain-water is intercepted by wells, and by galleries
hewn for miles in the water-bearing rock. Large reservoirs assist
to store this water after it is raised, and to equalize its distribution.</p>

<p>The climate is, for the greater part of the year, temperate and
healthy; the thermometer records an annual mean of 67° F.
Between June and September the temperature ranges
from 75° to 90°; the mean for December, January and
<span class="sidenote">Climate and Hygiene.</span>
February is 56°; March, May and November are mild.
Pleasant north-east winds blow for an average of 150 days a year,
cool northerly winds for 31 days, east winds 70 days, west for 34 days.
The north-west &ldquo;Gregale&rdquo; (Euroclydon of Acts xxvii. 14) blows
about the equinox, and occasionally, in the winter months, with
almost hurricane force for three days together; it is recorded to
have caused the drowning of 600 persons in the harbour in 1555.
This wind has been a constant menace to shipping at anchor; the
new breakwater on the Monarch Shoal was designed to resist its
ravages. The regular tides are hardly perceptible, but, under the
influence of barometric pressure and wind, the sea-level occasionally
varies as much as 2 ft. The average rainfall is 21 in.; it is, however,
uncertain; periods of drought have extended over three years.
Snow is seen once or twice in a generation; violent hailstorms
occur. On the 19th of October 1898, exceptionally large hailstones
fell&mdash;one, over 4 in. in length, being brought to the governor,
Sir Arthur Fremantle, for inspection. Mediterranean (sometimes
called &ldquo;Malta&rdquo;) fever has been traced by Colonel David Bruce to
a <i>Micrococcus melitensis</i>. The supply of water under pressure is
widely distributed and excellent. There is a modern system of
drainage for the towns, and all sewerage has been intercepted from
the Grand Harbour. There are efficient hospitals and asylums, a
system of sanitary inspection, and modernized quarantine stations.</p>

<p>It is hardly possible to differentiate between imported and
indigenous plants. Among the marine flora may be mentioned
<i>Porphyra laciniata</i>, the edible laver; <i>Codium tomentosum</i>,
a coarse species; <i>Padina pavonia</i>, common in shallow
<span class="sidenote">Flora.</span>
water; <i>Ulva latissima</i>; <i>Haliseris polypodioides</i>; <i>Sargassum bacciferum</i>;
the well-known gulf weed, probably transported from
the Atlantic; <i>Zostera marina</i>, forming dense beds in muddy
bays; the roots are cast up by storms and are valuable to dress the
fields. Among the land plants may be noted the blue anemone;
the ranunculus along the road-sides, with a strong perfume of
violets; the Malta heath, which flowers at all seasons; <i>Cynomorium
coccineum</i>, the curious &ldquo;Malta fungus,&rdquo; formerly so valued for
medicinal purposes that a guard was set for its preservation under
the rule of the Knights; the pheasant&rsquo;s-eye; three species of mallow
and geranium; <i>Oxalis cernua</i>, a very troublesome imported weed;
<i>Lotus edulis</i>; <i>Scorpiurus subvillosa</i>, wild and cultivated as forage;
two species of the horseshoe-vetch; the opium poppy; the yellow
and claret-coloured poppy; wild rose; <i>Crataegus azarolus</i>, of which
the fruit is delicious preserved; the ice-plant; squirting cucumber;
many species of <i>Umbelliferae</i>; <i>Labiatae</i>, to which the spicy flavour
of the honey (equal to that of Mt Hymettus) is ascribed; snap-dragons;
broom-rape; glass-wort; <i>Salsola soda</i>, which produces
when burnt a considerable amount of alkali; there are fifteen species
of orchids; the <i>gladiolus</i> and <i>iris</i> are also found; <i>Urginia scilla</i>, the
medicinal squill, abounds with its large bulbous roots near the sea;
seventeen species of sedges and seventy-seven grasses have been
recorded.</p>

<p>There are four species of lizard and three snakes, none of which
is venomous; a land tortoise, a turtle and a frog. Of birds very
few are indigenous; the jackdaw, blue solitary thrush,
spectacled warbler, the robin, kestrel and the herring-gull.
<span class="sidenote">Fauna.</span>
A bird known locally as <i>Hangi</i>, not met elsewhere in Europe, nests at
Filfla. Flights of quail and turtle doves, as well as teal and ducks,
stay long enough to afford sport. Of migratory birds over two hundred
species have been enumerated. The only wild mammalia in the
island are the hedgehogs, two species of weasel, the Norway rat,
and the domestic mouse. The Maltese dog was never wild and has
ceased to exist as a breed.</p>

<p>Malta has several species of zoophytes, sponges, mollusca and
crustacea. Insect life is represented by plant-bugs, locusts, crickets,
grasshoppers, cockroaches, dragon-flies, butterflies, numerous varieties
of moths, bees and mosquitoes.</p>

<p>Among the fish may be mentioned the tunny, dolphin, mackerel,
sardine, sea-bream, dentice and pagnell; wrasse, of exquisite rainbow
hue and good for food; members of the herring family, sardines,
anchovies, flying-fish, sea-pike; a few representatives of the cod
family, and some flat fish; soles (very rare); <i>Cernus</i> which grows
to large size; several species of grey and red mullet; eleven species
of <i>Triglidae</i>, including the beautiful flying gurnard whose colours
rival the angel-fish of the West Indies; and eighteen species of
mackerel, all migratory.</p>

<div class="center ptb2"><img style="width:510px; height:501px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img508.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>The real population of Malta, viz. of the country districts,
is to be differentiated from the cosmopolitan fringe of the cities.
There is continuous historical evidence that Malta
remains to-day what Diodorus Siculus described it in
<span class="sidenote">Population and Language.</span>
the 1st century, &ldquo;a colony of the Phoenicians&rdquo;;
this branch of the Caucasian race came down the great rivers
to the Persian Gulf and thence to Palestine. It carried the art
of navigation through the Mediterranean, along the Atlantic
seaboard as far as Great Britain, leaving colonies along its path.
In prehistoric times one of these colonies displaced previous
inhabitants of Libyan origin. The similarity of the megalithic
temples of Malta and of Stonehenge connect along the shores of
western Europe the earliest evidence of Phoenician civilization.
Philology proves that, though called &ldquo;Canaanites&rdquo; from having
sojourned in that land, the Phoenicians have no racial connexion
with the African descendants of Ham. No subsequent invader
of Malta attempted to displace the Phoenician race in the country
districts. The Carthaginians governed settlements of kindred
races with a light hand; the Romans took over the Maltese as
&ldquo;dedititii,&rdquo; not as a conquered race. Their conversion by St
Paul added difference of religion to the causes which prevented
mixture of race. The Arabs from Sicily came to eject the Byzantine
garrison; they treated the Maltese as friends, and were not
sufficiently numerous to colonize. The Normans came as fellow-Christians
and deliverers; they found very few Arabs in Malta.
The fallacy that Maltese is a dialect of Arabia has been luminously
disproved by A. E. Caruana, <i>Sull&rsquo; origine della lingua
Maltese</i>.</p>

<p>The upper classes have Norman, Spanish and Italian origin.
The knights of St John of Jerusalem, commonly called &ldquo;of
Malta,&rdquo; were drawn from the nobility of Catholic Europe. They
took vows of celibacy, but they frequently gave refuge in Malta
to relatives driven to seek asylum from feudal wars and disturbances
in their own lands. At the British occupation there
were about two dozen families bearing titles of nobility granted,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page509" id="page509"></a>509</span>
or recognized, by the Grand Masters, and descending by primogeniture.
These &ldquo;privileges&rdquo; were guaranteed, together with
the rights and religion of the islanders, when they became
British subjects, but no government has ever recognized papal
titles in Malta. High and low, all speak among themselves
the Phoenician Maltese, altogether different from the Italian
language; Italian was only spoken by 13.24% in 1901. Such
Italian as is spoken by the lingering minority has marked divergences
of pronunciation and inflexion from the language
of Rome and Florence. In 1901, in addition to visitors and
the naval and military forces, 18,922 Maltese spoke English,
and the number has been rapidly increasing.</p>

<p>In appearance the Maltese are a handsome, well-formed
race, about the middle height, and well set up; they have escaped
the negroid contamination noticeable in Sicily, and their features
are less dark than the southern Italians. The women are generally
smaller than the men, with black eyes, fine hair and graceful
carriage. They are a thrifty and industrious people, prolific
and devoted to their offspring, good-humoured, quick-tempered
and impressionable. The food of the working classes is principally
bread, with oil, olives, cheese and fruit, sometimes fish,
but seldom meat; common wine is largely imported from southern
Europe. The Maltese are strict adherents to the Roman Catholic
religion, and enthusiastic observers of festivals, fasts and
ceremonials.</p>

<p>In 1906 the birth-rate was 40.68 per thousand, and the excess
of births over deaths 2637. In April 1907 the estimated population
was 206,690 of whom 21,911 were in Gozo. This phenomenal
congestion of population gives interest to records of its
growth; in the 10th century there were 16,767 inhabitants in
Malta and 4514 in Gozo; the total population in 1514 was 22,000.
Estimates made at the arrival of the knights (1530) varied from
15,000 to 25,000: it was then necessary to import annually
10,000 quarters of grain from Sicily. The population in 1551
was, Malta 24,000, Gozo 7000. In 1582, 20,000 quarters of
imported grain were required to avert famine. A census of
1590 makes the population 30,500; in that year 3000 died of
want. The numbers rose in 1601 to 33,000; in 1614 to 41,084;
in 1632 to 50,113; in 1667 to 55,155; in 1667 11,000 are said to
have died of plague out of the total population. At the end
of the rule of the knights (1798) the population was estimated
at 100,000; sickness, famine and emigration during the blockade
of the French in Valletta probably reduced the inhabitants to
80,000. In 1829 the population was 114,236; in 1836, 119,878
(inclusive of the garrison); in 1873, 145,605; at the census in
1901 the civil population was 184,742. Sanitation decreases
the death-rate, religion keeps up the birth-rate. Nothing is
done to promote emigration or to introduce manufactures.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Towns and Villages.</i>&mdash;The capital is named after its founder, the
Grand Master de la Valette, but from its foundation it has been
called Valletta (pop. 1901, 24,685); it contains the palace of the
Grand Masters, the magnificent Auberges of the several &ldquo;Langues&rdquo;
of the Order, the unique cathedral of St John with the tombs of
the Knights and magnificent tapestries and marble work; a fine
opera house and hospital are conspicuous. Between the inner
fortifications of Valletta and the outer works, across the neck of
the peninsula, is the suburb of Floriana (pop. 7278). To the south-east
of Valletta, at the other side of the Grand Harbour, are the
cities of Senglea (pop. 8093), Vittoriosa (pop. 8993); and Cospicua
(pop. 12,184); this group is often spoken of as &ldquo;The Three Cities.&rdquo;
The old capital, near the centre of the island is variously called
Notabile, Città Vecchia (<i>q.v.</i>), and Medina, with its suburb Rabat,
its population in 1901 was 7515; here are the catacombs and the
ancient cathedral of Malta. Across the Marsamuscetto Harbour
of Valletta is a considerable modern town called Sliema. The
villages of Malta are Mellieha, St Paul&rsquo;s Bay, Musta, Birchircara, Lia,
Atterd, Balzan, Naxaro, Gargur, Misida, S. Julian&rsquo;s, S. Giuseppe,
Dingli, Zebbug, Siggieui, Curmi, Luca, Tarxein, Zurrico, Crendi,
Micabbiba, Circop, Zabbar, Asciak, Zeitun, Gudia and Marsa
Scirocco. The chief town of Gozo is called Victoria, and there are
several small villages.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Industry and Trade.</i>&mdash;The area under cultivation in 1906 was
41,534 acres. As a rule the tillers of the soil live away from their
lands, in some neighbouring village. The fields are small and
composed of terraces by which the soil has been walled up along
the contours of the hills, with enormous labour, to save it from
being washed away. Viewed from the sea, the top of one wall
just appearing above the next produces a barren effect; but the
aspect of the land from a hill in early spring is a beautiful contrast
of luxuriant verdure. It is estimated that there are about
10,000 small holdings averaging about four acres and intensely
cultivated. The grain crops are maize, wheat and barley; the
two latter are frequently sown together. In 1906, 13,000 acres
produced 17,975 quarters of wheat and 12,000 quarters of barley.
The principal fodder crops are green barley and a tall clover
called &ldquo;sulla&rdquo; (<i>Hedysarum coronarum</i>), having a beautiful
purple blossom. Vegetables of all sorts are easily grown, and
a rotation of these is raised on land irrigated from wells and
springs. Potatoes and onions are grown for exportation at
seasons when they are scarce in northern Europe. The rent of
average land is about £2 an acre, of very good land over £3;
favoured spots, irrigated from running springs, are worth up to
£12 an acre. Two, and often three, crops are raised in the year;
on irrigated land more than twice as many croppings are possible.
The presence of phosphates accounts for the fertility of a shallow
soil. There is a considerable area under vines, but it is generally
more profitable to sell the fruit as grapes than to convert it into
wine. Some of the best oranges in the world are grown, and
exported; but sufficient care is not taken to keep down insect
pests, and to replace old trees. Figs, apricots, nectarines and
peaches grow to perfection. Some cotton is raised as a rotation
crop, but no care is taken to improve the quality. The caroub
tree and the prickly pear are extensively cultivated. There are
exceptionally fine breeds of cattle, asses and goats; cows of a
large and very powerful build are used for ploughing. The
supply of butchers&rsquo; meat has to be kept up by constant importations.
More than two-thirds of the wheat comes from abroad;
fish, vegetables and fruit are also imported from Sicily in considerable
quantities. Excellent honey is produced in Malta; at
certain seasons tunny-fish and young dolphin (lampuca) are
abundant; other varieties of fish are caught all the year round.</p>

<p>About 5000 women and children are engaged in producing
Maltese lace. The weaving of cotton by hand-looms survives as
a languishing industry. Pottery is manufactured on a small
scale; ornamental carvings are made in Maltese stone and
exported to a limited extent. The principal resources of Malta
are derived from its being an important military station and the
headquarters of the Mediterranean fleet. There are great naval
docks, refitting yards, magazines and stores on the south-east
side of the Grand Harbour; small vessels of war have also been
built here. Steamers of several lines call regularly, and there is
a daily mail to Syracuse. The shipping cleared in 1905-1906
was 3524 vessels of 3,718,168 tons. Internal communications
include a railway about eight miles long from Valletta to Notabile;
there are electric tramways and motor omnibus services
in several directions. The currency is English. Local weights
and measures include the cantar, 175 &#8468;; salm, one imperial
quarter; cafiso, 4½ gallons; canna, 6 ft. 10½ in.; the tumolo
(256 sq. ca.), about a third of an acre.</p>

<p>The principal exports of local produce are potatoes, cumin seed,
vegetables, oranges, goats and sheep, cotton goods and stone.</p>

<p>To keep alive, in a fair standard of comfort, the population of
206,690, food supplies have to be imported for nine and a half
months in the year. The annual value of exports would be set
off against imported food for about one month and a half. The
Maltese have to pay for food imports by imperial wages, earned
in connexion with naval and military services, by commercial
services to passing steamers and visitors, by earnings which
emigrants send home from northern Africa and elsewhere, and
by interest on investments of Maltese capital abroad. A long
absence of the Mediterranean fleet, and withdrawals of imperial
forces, produce immediate distress.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Finance.</i>&mdash;The financial position in 1906-1907 is indicated by
the following: Public revenue £513,594 (including £51,039 carried
to revenue from capital); expenditure £446,849; imports (actual),
£1,219,819; imports in transit, £5,876,981; exports (actual), £123,510;
exports in transit £6,127,277; imports from the United Kingdom
(actual), £218,461. In March 1907 there were 8159 depositors in
the government savings bank, with £569,731 to their credit.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page510" id="page510"></a>510</span></p>

<p><i>Government.</i>&mdash;Malta is a crown colony, within the jurisdiction
of a high commissioner and a commander-in-chief, to whom important
questions of policy are reserved; in other matters the
administration is under a military governor (£3000), assisted
by a civil lieutenant-governor or chief secretary. There is an
executive council, now comprising eleven members with the
governor as president. The legislative council, under letters
patent of the 3rd of June 1903, is composed of the governor (president),
ten official members, and eight elected members. There
are eight electoral districts with a total of about 10,000 electors.
A voter is qualified on an income from property of £6, or by
paying rent to the same amount, or having the qualifications
required to serve as a common juror. There are no municipal
institutions. Letters patent, orders in council, and local ordinances
have the force of law. The laws of Justinian are still the
basis of the common law, the Code of Rohan is not altogether
abrogated, and considerable weight is still given to the Roman
Canon Law. The principal provisions of the Napoleonic Code
and some English enactments have been copied in a series of
ordinances forming the Statute Law. Latin was the language
of the courts till 1784, and was not completely supplanted by
Italian till 1815. The partial use of English (with illogical
limitations to the detriment of the Maltese-born British subjects
who speak English) was introduced by local ordinances and
orders in council at the end of the 19th century. The Maltese,
of whom 86% cannot understand Italian, are still liable to be
tried, even for their lives, in Italian, to them a foreign language.
The endeavour to restrict juries to those who understand
Italian reveals glaring incongruities.</p>

<p><i>Education.</i>&mdash;There were, in 1906, 98 elementary day schools, and
33 night schools. The attendance on the 1st of September 1905
was 16,530, the percentage on those enrolled 84.6; the total enrolment
was 18,719. The average cost per pupil in these schools was
35s. 11d. a year on daily attendance. There is a secondary school
for girls in Valletta, and one for boys in Gozo. A lyceum in Malta
had an average attendance of 464. The number of students at the
university was about 150. The average cost per student in the
lyceum was £8, 0s. 11d.; in the university £26, 10s. 1d. The fees in
these institutions are almost nominal, the middle-classes are thus
educated at the expense of the masses. In the 18th century the
government of the Knights and of the Inquisition did not favour
the education of the people, after 1800 British governors were slow
to make any substantial change. About the middle of the 19th
century it began to be recognized that the education of the people
was more conducive to the safety of the fortress than to leave in
ignorance congested masses of southern race liable to be swayed
spasmodically by prejudice. At first an attempt was made to
make Maltese a literary language by adapting the Arabic characters
to record it in print. This failed for several reasons, the foremost
being that the language was not Arabic but Phoenician, and because
professors and teachers, whose personal ascendancy was based on
the official prominence of Italian, did not realize that educational
institutions existed for the rising generation rather than to provide
salaries for alien teachers and men behind the times. Various
educational schemes were proposed, but they were easier to propose
than to carry into effect: no one, except Mr Savona, had the ability
to urge English as the basis of instruction, and he agitated and was
installed as director of education and made a member of the Executive.
The obstruction which he encountered alarmed him, and he
compromised by adopting a mixed system of both English and
Italian, <i>pari passu</i>, as the basis of Maltese education; he resigned
after a brief effort. Mr Savona&rsquo;s attempt to teach the Maltese
children simultaneously two foreign languages (of which they were
quite ignorant, and their teachers only partially conversant) without
first teaching how to read and write the native Maltese systematically
was continued for some years under an eminent archaeologist,
Dr A. A. Caruana, who became Director of Education. He began
to give some preference to English indirectly. On his resignation
Sir G. Strickland established a new system of education based on
the principle of beginning from the bottom, by teaching to read and
write in Maltese as the medium for assimilating, at a further stage,
either English or Italian, one at a time, and aiming at imparting
general knowledge in colloquial English. A series of school books,
in the Maltese language printed in Roman characters, with translations
in English interlined in different type, was produced at the
government printing office and sold at cost price. The parents
and guardians were called upon to select whether each child should
learn English or Italian next after learning reading, writing and
arithmetic in Maltese. About 89% recorded their preference in
favour of English at the outset; then, as a result of violent political
agitation, this percentage was considerably lowered, but soon crept
up again. Teachers and professors who were weak in English,
lawyers, newspaper men and others, combined to deprive these
reforms of their legitimate consequence, viz. that after a number
of years English should be the language of the courts as well as of
education, and to protect those belonging to the old order of knowledge
from the competition of young Maltese better educated than
themselves, whose rapid rise everywhere would be assured by
knowing English thoroughly. An order in council was enacted in
1899 providing that no Maltese (except students of theology) should
thenceforth suffer any detriment through inability to pass examinations
in Italian, in either the schools or university, but the fraction
of the Maltese who claim to speak Italian (13.24%) still command
sufficient influence to hamper the full enjoyment of this emancipation
by the majority. In the university most of the textbooks used
are English, nevertheless many of the lectures are still delivered in
Italian&mdash;for the convenience of some professors or to please the
politicians, rather than for the benefit of the students. The number
of students who enter the university without passing any examination
in Italian is rapidly increasing; the longer the period of transition,
the greater the detriment to the rising generation.</p>

<p><i>History and Antiquities.</i>&mdash;The earliest inhabitants of Malta
(Melita) and Gozo (Gaulos) belonged to a culture-circle
which included the whole of the western Mediterranean, and
to a race which perhaps originated from North Africa; and
it is they, and not the Phoenicians, who were the builders
of the remarkable megalithic monuments which these islands
contain, the Gigantia in Gozo, Hagiar Kim and Mnaidra
near Crendi, the rock-cut hypogeum of Halsaflieni,<a name="fa1a" id="fa1a" href="#ft1a"><span class="sp">1</span></a> and
the megalithic buildings on the hill of Corradino in Malta,
being the most noteworthy. The contemporaneity of these
structures has been demonstrated by the identity of the pottery
and other objects discovered in them, including some remarkable
steatopygic figures in stone, and it is clear that they belong to
the neolithic period, numerous flints, but no metal, having been
found. Those that have been mentioned seem to have been
sanctuaries (some of them in part dwelling-places), but Halsaflieni
was an enormous ossuary, of which others may have existed in
other parts of the island; for the numerous rock-cut tombs
which are everywhere to be seen belong to the Phoenician and
Roman periods. In these buildings there is a great preference
for apsidal terminations to the internal chambers, and the
façades are as a rule slightly curved. The numerous niches,
generally containing sacrificial (?) tables,<a name="fa2a" id="fa2a" href="#ft2a"><span class="sp">2</span></a> are often approached
by window-like openings hewn out of one of the flat slabs by
which they are enclosed. The surface of the stones in the
interior is often pitted, as a form of ornamentation. Even the
barren islet of Comino, between Malta and Gozo, was inhabited
in prehistoric times.</p>

<p>To the Phoenician period, besides the tombs already mentioned,
belong some remains of houses and cisterns, and (probably) a
few round towers which are scattered about the island, while
the important Roman house at Cittavecchia is the finest
monument of this period in the islands.</p>

<p>The Carthaginians came to Malta in the 6th century <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, not
as conquerors, but as friends of a sister Phoenician colony
(Freeman, <i>Hist. Sicily</i>, i. 255): Carthage in her struggle with
Rome was at last driven to levy oppressive tribute, whereupon
the Maltese gave up the Punic garrison to Titus Sempronius
under circumstances described by Livy (xxi. 51). The
Romans did not treat the Maltese as conquered enemies, and at
once gave them the privileges of a <i>municipium</i>; Cicero (<i>in Verrem</i>)
refers to the Maltese as &ldquo;Socii.&rdquo; Nothing was to be gained by
displacing the Phoenician inhabitants in a country from which
any race less thrifty would find life impossible by agriculture. On
the strength of a monument bearing his name, it has been surmised
that Hannibal was born in Malta, while his father was
governor-general of Sicily; he certainly did not die in Malta.
There is evidence from Cicero (<i>in Verrem</i>) that a very high
stage of manufacturing and commercial prosperity, attained in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page511" id="page511"></a>511</span>
Carthaginian times, continued in Malta under the Romans.
The Phoenician temple of Juno, which stood on the site of
Fort St Angelo, is also mentioned by Valerius Maximus. An
inscription records the restoration of the temple of Proserpine
by Cheriston, a freed-man of Augustus and procurator of
Malta. Diodorus Siculus (L. V., c. 4) speaks of the importance
and ornamentation of Maltese dwellings, and to this
day remains of palaces and dwellings of the Roman period
indicate a high degree of civilization and wealth. When forced
to select a place of exile, Cicero was at first (<i>ad Att.</i> III. 4,
X. i. 8, 9) attracted to Malta, over which he had ruled as quaestor
75 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> Among his Maltese friends were Aulus Licinius and
Diodorus. Lucius Castricius is mentioned as a Roman governor
under Augustus. Publius was &ldquo;chief of the island&rdquo; when St
Paul was shipwrecked (Acts xxvii. 7); and is said to have become
the first Christian bishop of Malta. The site where the cathedral
at Notabile now stands is reputed to have been the residence of
Publius and to have been converted by him into the first Christian
place of worship, which was rebuilt in 1090 by Count
Roger, the Norman conqueror of Malta. The Maltese catacombs
are strikingly similar to those of Rome, and were likewise
used as places of burial and of refuge in time of persecution.
They contain clear indication of the interment of martyrs. St
Paul&rsquo;s Bay was the site of shipwreck of the apostle in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 58;
the &ldquo;topon diathalasson&rdquo; referred to in Acts is the strait between
Malta and the islet of Selmun. The claim that St Paul
was shipwrecked at Meleda off the Dalmatian coast, and not at
Malta, has been clearly set at rest, on nautical grounds, by Mr
Smith of Jordanhill (<i>Voyage and Shipwreck of St Paul</i>, London,
1848). According to tradition and to St Chrysostom (Hom. 54)
the stay of the apostle resulted in the conversion of the Maltese
to Christianity. The description of the islanders in Acts as
&ldquo;barbaroi&rdquo; confirms the testimony of Diodorus Siculus that
they were Phoenicians, neither hellenized nor romanized. The
bishopric of Malta is referred to by Rocco Pirro (<i>Sicilia sacra</i>),
and by Gregory the Great (<i>Epist.</i> 2, 44; 9, 63; 10, 1). It appears
that Malta was not materially affected by the Greek schism, and
remained subject to Rome.</p>

<p>On the final division of the Roman dominions in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 395
Malta was assigned to the empire of Constantinople. On the
third Arab invasion, <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 870, the Maltese joined forces against
the Byzantine garrison, and 3000 Greeks were massacred.
Unable to garrison the island with a large force, the Arabs
cleared a zone between the central stronghold, Medina, and the
suburb called Rabat, to restrict the fortified area. Many Arab
coins, some Kufic inscriptions and several burial-places were left
by the Arabs; but they did not establish their religion or leave a
permanent impression on the Phoenician inhabitants, or deprive
the Maltese language of the characteristics which differentiate
it from Arabic. There is no historical evidence that the domination
of the Goths and Vandals in the Mediterranean ever extended
to Malta; there are fine Gothic arches in two old palaces
at Notabile, but these were built after the Norman conquest of
Malta. In 1090 Count Roger the Norman (son of Tancred de
Hauteville), then master of Sicily, came to Malta with a small
retinue; the Arab garrison was unable to offer effective opposition,
and the Maltese were willing and able to welcome the
Normans as deliverers and to hold the island after the immediate
withdrawal of Count Roger. A bishop of Malta was witness to a
document in 1090. The Phoenician population had continued
Christian during the mild Arab rule. Under the Normans the
power of the Roman Church quickly augmented, tithes were
granted, and ecclesiastical buildings erected and endowed. The
Normans, like the Arabs, were not numerically strong; the rule of
both, in Sicily as well as Malta, was based on a recognition of
municipal institutions under local officials; the Normans, however,
exterminated the Mahommedans. Gradually feudal
customs asserted themselves. In 1193 Margarito Brundusio
received Malta as a fief with the title of count; he was Grand
Admiral of Sicily. Constance, wife of the emperor Henry IV.
of Germany became, in 1194, heiress of Sicily and Malta; she was
the last of the Norman dynasty. The Grand Admiral of Sicily
in 1223 was Henry, count of Malta. He had led 300 Maltese at
the capture of two forts in Tripoli by the Genoese. In 1265 Pope
Alexander IV. conferred the crown of Sicily on Charles of Anjou
to the detriment of Manfred, from whom the French won the
kingdom at the battle of Benevento. Under the will of Corradino
a representative of the blood of Roger the Norman, Peter of
Aragon claimed the succession, and it came to him by the
revolution known as &ldquo;the Sicilian Vespers&rdquo; when 28,000 French
were exterminated in Sicily. Charles held Malta for two years
longer, when the Aragonese fleet met the French off Malta, and
finally crushed them in the Grand Harbour. In 1427 the Turks
raided Malta and Gozo, they carried many of the inhabitants
into captivity, but gained no foothold. The Maltese joined the
Spaniards in a disastrous raid against Gerbi on the African coast
in 1432. In 1492 the Aragonese expelled the Jews. Dissatisfaction
arose under Aragonese rule from the periodical grants of
Malta, as a marquisate or countship, to great officers of state
or illegitimate descendants of the sovereign. Exemption was
obtained from these incidences of feudalism by large payments
to the Crown in return for charters covenanting that Malta should
for ever be administered under the royal exchequer without the
intervention of intermediary feudal lords. This compact was
twice broken, and in 1428 the Maltese paid King Alfonso 30,000
florins for a confirmation of privileges, with a proviso that entitled
them to resist by force of arms any intermediate lord that his
successors might attempt to impose. Under the Aragonese,
Malta, as regards local affairs, was administered by a <i>Università</i> or
municipal commonwealth with wide and indefinite powers,
including the election of its officers, Capitan di Verga, Jurats,
&amp;c. The minutes of the &ldquo;Consiglio Popolare&rdquo; of this period are
preserved, showing it had no legislative power; this was vested
in the king, and was exercised despotically in the interests of the
Crown. The Knights of St John having been driven from Rhodes
by the Turks, obtained the grant of Malta, Gozo and Tripoli
in 1530 from the emperor Charles V., subject to a reversion in
favour of the emperor&rsquo;s successor in the kingdom of Aragon
should the knights leave Malta, and to the annual tribute of a
falcon in acknowledgment that Malta was under the suzerainty
of Spain. The Maltese, at first, challenged the grant as a breach
of the charter of King Alfonso, but eventually welcomed the
knights. The Grand Master de l&rsquo;Isle Adam, on entering the
ancient capital of Notabile, swore for himself and his successors
to maintain the rights and liberties of the Maltese. The Order of
St John took up its abode on the promontory guarded by the
castle of St Angelo on the southern shore of the Grand Harbour,
and, in expectation of attacks from the Turks, commenced to
fortify the neighbouring town called the Borgo. The knights
lived apart from the Maltese, and derived their principal revenues
from estates of the Order in the richest countries of Europe.
They accumulated wealth by war, or by privateering against the
Turks and their allies. The African Arabs under Selim Pasha in
1551 ravaged Gozo, after an unsuccessful attempt on Malta,
repulsed by cavalry under Upton, an English knight. The
Order of St John and the Christian Maltese now realized that
an attempt to exterminate them would soon be made by
Soliman II., and careful preparations were made to meet the
attack.</p>

<p>The great siege of Malta which made the island and its knights
famous, and checked the advance of Mahommedan power in
southern and western Europe, began in May 1565. The fighting
men of the defenders are variously recorded between 6100 and
9121; the roll comprises one English knight, Oliver Starkey.
The Mahommedan forces were estimated from 29,000 to 38,500.
Jehan Parisot de la Valette had participated in the defence of
Rhodes, and in many naval engagements. He had been taken
prisoner by Dragut, who made him row for a year as a galley
slave till ransomed. This Grand Master had gained the confidence
of Philip of Spain, the friendship of the viceroy of Sicily,
of the pope and of the Genoese admiral, Doria. The Sultan
placed his troops under the veteran Mustapha, and his galleys
under his youthful relative Piali, he hesitated to make either
supreme and ordered them to await the arrival of Dragut with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page512" id="page512"></a>512</span>
his Algerian allies, before deciding on their final plans. Meanwhile,
against Mustapha&rsquo;s better judgment, Piali induced the
council of war to attack St Elmo, in order to open the way for
his fleet to an anchorage, safe in all weathers, in Marsamuscetto
harbour. This strategical blunder was turned to the best
advantage by La Valette, who so prolonged the most heroic
defence of St Elmo that the Turks lost 7000 killed and as many
wounded before exterminating the 1200 defenders, who fell at
their post. In the interval Dragut was mortally wounded, the
attack on Notabile was neglected, valuable time lost, and the
main objective (the Borgo) and St Angelo left intact. The
subsequent siege of St Angelo, and its supporting fortifications,
was marked by the greatest bravery on both sides. The knights
and their Maltese troops fought for death or victory, without
asking or giving quarter. The Grand Master proved as wise a
leader as he was brave. By September food and ammunition
were getting scarce, a large relieving force was expected from
Sicily, and Piali became restive, on the approach of the equinox,
for the safety of his galleys. At last the viceroy of Sicily, who
had the Spanish and allied fleets at his disposal, was spurred to
action by his council. He timidly landed about 6000 or 8000
troops at the north-west of Malta and withdrew. The Turks
began a hurried embarcation and allowed the Christians to join
forces at Notabile; then, hearing less alarming particulars of the
relieving force, Mustapha relanded his reluctant troops, faced his
enemies in the open, and was driven in confusion to his ships on
the 8th of September.</p>

<p>The Order thus reached the highest pinnacle of its fame, and
new knights flocked to be enrolled therein from the flower of the
nobility of Europe; La Valette refused a cardinal&rsquo;s hat, determined
not to impair his independence. He made his name
immortal by founding on Mt Sceberras &ldquo;a city built by gentlemen
for gentlemen&rdquo; and making Valletta a magnificent example
of fortification, unrivalled in the world. The pope and other
sovereigns donated vast sums for this new bulwark of Christianity,
but, as its ramparts grew in strength, the knights were
slow to seek the enemy in his own waters, and became false to
their traditional strategy as a naval power. Nevertheless, they
harassed Turkish commerce and made booty in minor engagements
throughout the 16th and 18th centuries, and they took
part as an allied Christian power in the great victory of Lepanto.
With the growth of wealth and security the martial spirit of the
Order began to wane, and so also did its friendly relations with
the Maltese. The field for recruiting its members, as well as its
landed estates, became restricted by the Reformation in England
and Germany, and the French knights gradually gained a preponderance
which upset the international equilibrium of the
Order. The election of elderly Grand Masters became prevalent,
the turmoil and chances of frequent elections being acceptable
to younger members. The civil government became neglected
and disorganized, licentiousness increased, and riots began to
be threatening. Expenditure on costly buildings was almost
ceaseless, and kept the people alive. In 1614 the Vignacourt
aqueduct was constructed. The Jesuits established a university,
but they were expelled and their property confiscated in 1768.
British ships of war visited Malta in 1675, and in 1688 a fleet
under the duke of Grafton came to Valletta. The fortifications
of the &ldquo;Three Cities&rdquo; were greatly strengthened under the Grand
Master Cotoner.</p>

<p>In 1722 the Turkish prisoners and slaves, then very numerous,
formed a conspiracy to rise and seize the island. Premature discovery
was followed by prompt suppression. Castle St Angelo
and the fort of St James were, in 1775, surprised by rebels,
clamouring against bad government; this rising is known as the
Rebellion of the Priests, from its leader, Mannarino. The last
but one of the Grand Masters who reigned in Malta, de Rohan,
restored good government, abated abuses and promulgated a code
of laws; but the ascendancy acquired by the Inquisition over the
Order, the confiscation of the property of the knights in France
on the outbreak of the Revolution, and the intrigues of the
French made the task of regenerating the Order evidently hopeless
in the changed conditions of Christendom. On the death of
Rohan the French knights disagreed as to the selection of his
successor, and a minority were able to elect, in 1797, a
German of weak character, Ferdinand Hompesch, as the last
Grand Master to rule in Malta. Bonaparte had arranged to
obtain Malta by treachery, and he took possession without
resistance in June 1798; after a stay of six days he proceeded
with the bulk of his forces to Egypt, leaving General Vaubois
with 6000 troops to hold Valletta. The exiled knights made an
attempt to reconstruct themselves under the emperor Paul of
Russia, but finally the Catholic parent stem of the Order settled
in Rome and continues there under papal auspices. It still
comprises members who take vows of celibacy and prove the
requisite number of quarterings.</p>

<p>Towards the close of the rule of the knights in Malta feudal
institutions had been shaken to their foundations, but the
transition to republican rule was too sudden and extreme for
the people to accept it. The French plundered the churches,
abolished monks, nuns and nobles, and set up forthwith the
ways and doings of the French Revolution. Among other
laws Bonaparte enacted that French should at once be the
official language, that 30 young men should every year be sent
to France for their education; that all foreign monks be expelled,
that no new priests be ordained before employment
could be found for those existing; that ecclesiastical jurisdiction
should cease; that neither the bishop nor the priests could
charge fees for sacramental ministrations, &amp;c. Stoppage of
trade, absence of work (in a population of which more than
half had been living on foreign revenues of the knights), and
famine, followed the defeat of Bonaparte at the Nile, and
the failure of his plans to make Malta a centre of French
trade. An attempt to seize church valuables at Notabile was
forcibly resisted by the Maltese, and general discontent broke out
into open rebellion on the 2nd of September 1798. The French
soon discovered to their dismay that, from behind the rubble
walls of every field, the agile Maltese were unassailable. The
prospect of an English blockade of Malta encouraged the revolt,
of which Canon Caruana became the leader. Nelson was appealed
to, and with the aid of Portuguese allies he established a blockade
and deputed Captain Ball, R. N. (afterwards the first governor)
to assume, on the 9th of February 1799, the provisional administration
of Malta and to superintend operations on land. Nelson
recognized the movement in Malta as a successful revolution
against the French, and upheld the contention that the king of
Sicily (as successor to Charles V. in that part of the former kingdom
of Aragon) was the legitimate sovereign of Malta. British
troops were landed to assist in the siege; few lives were lost in
actual combat, nevertheless famine and sickness killed thousands
of the inhabitants, and finally forced the French to surrender to
the allies. Canon Caruana and other leaders of the Maltese
aspired to obtain for Malta the freedom of the Roman Catholic
religion guaranteed by England in Canada and other dependencies,
and promoted a petition in order that Malta should come
under the strong power of England rather than revert to the
kingdom of the two Sicilies.</p>

<p>The Treaty of Amiens (1802) provided for the restoration of the
island to the Order of St John; against this the Maltese strongly
protested, realizing that it would be followed by the re-establishment
of French influence. The English flag was flown side by
side with the Neapolitan, and England actually renewed war
with France sooner than give up Malta. The Treaty of Paris
(1814), with the acclamations of the Maltese, confirmed Great
Britain in the aggregation of Malta to the empire.</p>

<p>A period elapsed before the government of Malta again became
self-supporting, during which over £600,000 was contributed by
the British exchequer in aid of revenue, and for the importation
of food-stuffs. The restoration of Church property, the re-establishment
of law and administration on lines to which the people
were accustomed before the French invasion, and the claiming
for the Crown of the vast landed property of the knights, were
the first cares of British civil rule. As successor to the Order, the
Crown claimed and eventually established (by the negotiations
in Rome of Sir Frederick Hankey, Sir Gerald Strickland and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page513" id="page513"></a>513</span>
Sir Lintorn Simmons) with regard to the presentation of the
bishopric (worth about £4000 a year) the right to veto the appointment
of distasteful candidates. This right was exercised to
secure the nomination of Canon Caruana and later of Monsignor
Pace. When the pledge, given by the Treaty of Amiens, to restore
the Order of St John with a national Maltese &ldquo;langue,&rdquo; could not
be fulfilled, political leaders began demanding instead the re-establishment
of the &ldquo;Consiglio Popolare&rdquo; of Norman times (without
reflecting that it never had legislative power); but by degrees
popular aspirations developed in favour of a free constitution on
English lines. The British authorities steadily maintained that,
at least until the mass of the people became educated, representative
institutions would merely screen irresponsible oligarchies.
After the Treaty of Paris stability of government developed,
and many important reforms were introduced under the strong
government of the masterful Sir Thomas Maitland; he acted
promptly, without seeking popularity or fearing the reverse, and
he ultimately gained more real respect than any other governor,
not excepting the marquess of Hastings, who was a brilliant and
sympathetic administrator. Trial by jury for criminal cases
was established in 1829. A council of government, of which the
members were nominated, was constituted by letters patent in
1835, but this measure only increased the agitation for a representative
legislature. Freedom of the press and many salutary
innovations were brought about on a report of John Austin and
G. C. Lewis, royal commissioners, appointed in 1836. The
basis of taxation was widened, sinecures abolished, schools
opened in the country districts, legal procedure simplified, and
Police established on an English footing. Queen Adelaide
<span class="correction" title="amended from vistied">visited</span> Malta in 1838 and founded the Anglican collegiate church
of St Paul. Sir F. Hankey as chief secretary was for many
years the principal official of the civil administration. In 1847
Mr R. Moore O&rsquo;Ferrall was appointed civil governor. In June
1849 the constitution of the council was altered to comprise
ten nominated and eight elected members.</p>

<p>The revolutions in Italy caused about this time many, including
Crispi and some of the most intellectual Italians, to take
refuge in Malta. These foreigners introduced new life into politics
and the press, and made it fashionable for educated Maltese to
delude themselves with the idea that the Maltese were Italians,
because a few of them could speak the language of the peninsula.
A clerical reaction followed against new progressive ideas
and English methods of development. After much unreasoning
vituperation the Irish Catholic civil governor, who had arrived
amidst the acclamations of all, left his post in disgust. His
successor as civil governor was Sir W. Reid, who had formerly
held military command. His determined attempts to promote
education met with intense opposition and little success. At
this period the Crimean War brought great wealth and commercial
prosperity to Malta. Under Sir G. Le Marchant, in
1858, the nominal rule of military governors was re-established,
but the civil administration was largely confided to Sir Victor
Houlton as chief secretary, whilst the real power began to be
concentrated in the hands of Sir A. Dingli, the Crown advocate,
who was the interpreter of the law, and largely its maker, as well
as the principal depository of local knowledge, able to prevent the
preferment of rivals, and to countenance the barrier which
difference of language created between governors and governed.
The civil service gravitated into the hands of a clique. At this
period much money was spent on the Marsa extension of the
Grand Harbour, but the rapid increase in the size of steamships
made the scheme inadequate, and limited its value prematurely.
The military defences were entirely remodelled under Sir G.
Le Marchant, and considerable municipal improvements and
embellishments were completed. But this governor was obstructed
and misrepresented by local politicians as vehemently
as his predecessors and his successors. Ministers at home have
often appeared to be inclined to the policy of pleasing by avoiding
the reforming of what might be left as it was found. Sir A.
Dingli adapted a considerable portion of the Napoleonic Code in a
series of Malta Ordinances, but stopped short at points likely to
cause agitation. Sir P. Julyan was appointed royal commissioner
on the civil establishments, and Sir P. Keenan on
education; their work revived the reform movement in 1881.
Mr Savona led an agitation for a more sincere system of education
on English lines. Fierce opposition ensued, and the <i>pari passu</i>
compromise was adopted to which reference is made in the
section on <i>Education</i> above; Mr Savona was an able organizer,
and began the real emancipation of the Maltese masses from
educational ignorance; but he succumbed to agitation before
accomplishing substantial results.</p>

<p>An executive council was established in 1881, and the franchise
was extended in 1883. A quarter of a century of Sir Victor
Houlton&rsquo;s policy of <i>laissez-faire</i> was changed in 1883 by the
appointment of Sir Walter Hely-Hutchinson as chief secretary.
An attempt was made to utilize fully the abilities of this eminent
administrator by creating him civil lieutenant-governor, in whom
to concentrate both the real and the nominal power of detailed
administration; but the military authorities objected to his
corresponding directly with the Colonial Office; and a political
deadlock began to develop. Sir A. Dingli was transferred from
an administrative office to that of chief justice. With the continuance
of military power over details, the public could not
understand where responsibility really rested. The elected
members under the leadership of Dr Mizzi clamoured for more
power, opposed reforms and protested against the carrying of
government measures by the casting vote of a military governor
as president of the council. To force a crisis, abstention of
elected members from the council was resorted to, together with
the election of notoriously unfit candidates. Under these circumstances
a constitution of a more severe type was recommended
by those responsible for the government of Malta and was about
to be adopted, as the only alternative to a deadlock, by the
imperial authorities.</p>

<p>A regulation excluding Maltese from the navy (because of their
speaking on board a language that their officers did not understand)
provoked from Trinity College, Cambridge, the Strickland
correspondence in <i>The Times</i> on the constitutional rights of the
Maltese, and a leading article induced the Colonial Office to try
an experiment known as the Strickland-Mizzi Constitution of
1887. This constitution (abolished in 1903) ended a period of
government by presidential casting votes and official ascendancy.
For the first time the elected members were placed in a majority;
they were given three seats in the executive council; in local
questions the government had to make every effort to carry the
majority by persuasion. When persuasion failed and imperial
interests, or the rights of unrepresented minorities, were involved
the power of the Crown to legislate by order in council could be
(and was) freely used. This system had the merit of counteracting
any abuse of power by the bureaucracy. It brought to
bear on officials effective criticism, which made them alert and
hard-working. Governor Simmons eventually gave his support
to the new constitution, which was received with acclamation.
Strickland, who had been elected while an undergraduate on the
cry of equality of rights for Maltese and English, and Mizzi, the
leader of the anti-English agitation, were, as soon as elected,
given seats in the executive council to cooperate with the government;
but their aims were irreconcilable. Mizzi wanted to
undo the educational forms of Mr Savona, to ensure the predominance
of the Italian language and to work the council as a
caucus. Strickland desired to replace bureaucratic government
by a system more in touch with the independent gentlemen of the
country, and to introduce English ideas and precedents. Friction
soon arose. Mizzi cared little for a constitution that did not make
him complete master of the situation, and resigned his post in the
government.</p>

<p>Sir Walter Hely-Hutchinson left Malta in March 1889, and was
succeeded by Sir Gerald Strickland (Count Delia Catena), who
lost no time in pushing, and carrying with a rapidity that was
considered hasty, reforms that had been retarded for years. The
majorities behind the government began to dwindle and agitation
to grow. Meanwhile the Royal Malta Militia was established
as a link between the Maltese and the garrison. The police
were reorganized with proper pay, criminal laws were rigorously
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page514" id="page514"></a>514</span>
enforced. A naval officer was placed over the police to diminish
difficulties with the naval authorities and sailors. A marine
force was raised to stop smuggling; and the subtraction of coal
during coaling operations was stopped by drastic legislation.
The civil service was reorganized so as to reward merit and work
by promotion. Tenders were strictly enforced in letting government
property and contracts; a largely increased revenue was
applied on water supply, drainage and other works. Lepers
were segregated by law.</p>

<p>The Malta marriage question evoked widespread agitation;
Sir A. Dingli had refrained from making any provision in his
code as to marrying. The Maltese relied on the Roman Canon
Law, the English on the common law of England, Scots or
Irish had nothing but the English law to fall back upon. Maltese
authorities were ignorant of the disabilities of British Nonconformists
at common law, and they had not perceived that persons
with a British domicile could not evade their own laws by marrying
in Malta, <i>e.g.</i> that an English girl up to the age of 21 required
the father&rsquo;s or guardian&rsquo;s consent from which a Maltese was
legally exempt at 18. Sir G. Strickland preferred legislation to
the covering up of difficulties by governors&rsquo; licences and appeals
to incongruous precedents. Sir Lintorn Simmons was appointed
envoy to the Holy See, to ascertain how far legislation might be
pushed in the direction of civil marriage without justifying
clerical agitation and obstruction in the council. He succeeded
in coming to an agreement with Rome. Nevertheless Sir A.
Dingli and ecclesiastics of all denominations, for conflicting
reasons, swelled the opposition against the liberal concessions
obtained from Leo XIII. The legal necessity for legislation in
accordance with the agreement was, nevertheless, on a special
reference, submitted to the privy council, whose decision affirmed
the <span class="correction" title="amended from advisibility">advisability</span> of legislation and the need for validating retrospectively
marriages not supported by either Maltese or English
common law. Agitation in the imperial parliament stopped
government action, but the publicity of the finding of the privy
council warned all concerned against the risk of neglecting the
common law of the empire whenever they were not prepared to
follow the <i>lex loci contractus</i>.</p>

<p>Since the British occupation it was disputed whether the
military authorities had the right to alienate for the benefit of the
imperial exchequer fortress sites no longer required for defence.
The reversion of such property was claimed for the local civil
government, and the principles governing these rights were ultimately
laid down by an order in council, which also determined
military rights to restrict buildings within the range of forts.
The co-operation of naval and military authorities was obtained
for the construction, at imperial expense, of the breakwater
designed to save Malta from being abandoned by long and deep
draft modern vessels. British-born subjects were given the
right to be tried in English. The new system of education
(already described) was set up, and many new schools were built
with funds provided by order in council against the wishes of the
elected majority.</p>

<p>An order in council (1899) making English the language of the
courts after fifteen years (by which the Maltese would have
obtained the right to be tried in English) was promulgated at a
time when the system of taxation was also being revised; henceforth
agitation in favour of Italian and against taxation attained
proportions unpleasant for those who preferred popularity to
reform and progress. The elected members demanded the
recall of Sir G. Strickland on his refusing to change his policy.
The military governor gave way, as regards making English the
language of the courts on a fixed date, but educational reforms
and the imposition of new taxes (those in Malta being 27s. 6d. per
head, against 93s. in England) were enacted by an order in council
notwithstanding the agitation. Mr Mereweather was appointed
chief secretary and civil lieutenant-governor in 1902, and Sir
Gerald Strickland became governor and commander-in-chief of
the Leeward Islands. Governor Sir F. Grenfell was created a
peer. Strenuous efforts were made to placate the Italian party
in the administration of the educational reforms; but, as these
were not repealed, elected members refused supply, and kept away
from the council. Persistence in this course led to the repeal
by letters-patent of 1903 of the Strickland-Mizzi Constitution of
1887. In place of occasional orders in council for important
matters in urgent cases, bureaucratic government with an official
majority was again, with its drawbacks, fully re-established for all
local affairs great and small. The representatives of the people
were repeatedly re-elected, only to resign again and again as a
protest against a restricted constitution.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MALTA<a name="ar2" id="ar2"></a></span> (or <span class="sc">Mediterranean</span>) <span class="bold">FEVER,</span> a disease long prevalent
of Malta and formerly at Gibraltar, as well as other Mediterranean
centres, characterized by prolonged high temperature, with
anaemia, pain and swelling in the joints, and neuritis, lasting on
an average four months but extending even to two or three years.
Its pathology was long obscure, but owing to conclusive research
on the part of Colonel (afterwards Sir) David Bruce, to which
contributions were made by various officers of the R.A.M.C. and
others, this problem had now been solved. A specific micro-organism,
the <i>Micrococcus melitensis</i>, was discovered in 1887, and
it was traced to the milk of the Maltese goats. A commission
was sent out to Malta in 1904 to investigate the question, and
after three years&rsquo; work its conclusions were embodied in a report
by Colonel Bruce in 1907. It was shown that the disappearance
of the disease from Gibraltar had synchronized with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page515" id="page515"></a>515</span>
non-importation of goats from Malta; and preventive measures
adopted in Malta in 1906, by banishing goats&rsquo; milk from the
military and naval dietary, put a stop to the occurrence of
cases. In the treatment of Malta fever a vaccine has been used
with considerable success.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MALTE-BRUN, CONRAD<a name="ar3" id="ar3"></a></span> (1755-1826), French geographer,
was born on the 12th of August 1755 at Thisted in Denmark, and
died at Paris on the 14th of December 1826. His original name
was Malte Conrad Bruun. While a student at Copenhagen he
made himself famous partly by his verses, but more by the violence
of his political pamphleteering; and at length, in 1800, the legal
actions which the government authorities had from time to time
instituted against him culminated in a sentence of banishment.
The principles which he had advocated were those of the French
Revolution, and after first seeking asylum in Sweden he found his
way to Paris. There he looked forward to a political career; but,
when Napoleon&rsquo;s personal ambition began to unfold itself, Malte-Brun
was bold enough to protest, and to turn elsewhere for employment
and advancement. He was associated with Edme
Mentelle (1730-1815) in the compilation of the <i>Géographie mathématique ... de
toutes les parties du monde</i> (Paris, 1803-1807,
16 vols.), and he became recognized as one of the best geographers
of France. He is remembered, not only as the author of
six volumes of the learned <i>Précis de la géographie universelle</i>
(Paris, 1810-1829), continued by other hands after his death, but
also as the originator of the <i>Annales des voyages</i> (1808), and
one of the founders of the Geographical Society of Paris. His
second son, <span class="sc">Victor Adolphe Malte-Brun</span> (1816-1889), followed
his father&rsquo;s career of geographer, and was a voluminous author.</p>


<div class="center ptb6"><img style="width:200px; height:36px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img000.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p><span class="bold">MALTHUS, THOMAS ROBERT<a name="ar4" id="ar4"></a></span> (1766-1834), English economist,
was born in 1766 at the Rookery, near Guildford, Surrey,
a small estate owned by his father, Daniel Malthus, a gentleman
of good family and independent fortune, of considerable culture,
the friend and correspondent of Rousseau and one of his executors.
Young Malthus was never sent to a public school, but
received his education from private tutors. In 1784 he was sent
to Cambridge, where he was ninth wrangler, and became fellow
of his college (Jesus) in 1797. The same year he received orders,
and undertook the charge of a small parish in Surrey. In the
following year he published the first edition of his great work,
<i>An Essay on the Principle of Population as it affects the Future
Improvement of Society, with Remarks on the Speculations of Mr
Godwin, M. Condorcet, and other Writers</i>. The work excited a
good deal of surprise as well as attention; and with characteristic
thoroughness and love of truth the author went abroad to collect
materials for the verification and more exhaustive treatment of
his views. As Britain was then at war with France, only the
northern countries of Europe were quite open to his research at
that time; but during the brief Peace of Amiens Malthus continued
his investigations in France and Switzerland. The result of
these labours appeared in the greatly enlarged and more mature
edition of his work published in 1803. In 1805 Malthus married
happily, and not long after was appointed professor of modern
history and political economy in the East India Company&rsquo;s
College at Haileybury. This post he retained till his death
suddenly from heart disease on the 23rd of December 1834.
Malthus was one of the most amiable, candid and cultured of
men. In all his private relations he was not only without
reproach, but distinguished for the beauty of his character. He
bore popular abuse and misrepresentation without the slightest
murmur or sourness of temper. The aim of his inquiries was
to promote the happiness of mankind, which could be better
accomplished by pointing out the real possibilities of progress
than by indulging in vague dreams of perfectibility apart from
the actual facts which condition human life.</p>

<p>Malthus&rsquo;s <i>Essay on Population</i> grew out of some discussions
which he had with his father respecting the perfectibility of
society. His father shared the theories on that subject of Condorcet
and Godwin; and his son combated them on the ground
that the realization of a happy society will always be hindered
by the miseries consequent on the tendency of population to
increase faster than the means of subsistence. His father was
struck by the weight and originality of his views, asked him to
put them in writing, and then recommended the publication of
the manuscript. It was in this way the <i>Essay</i> saw the light.
Thus it will be seen that both historically and philosophically
the doctrine of Malthus was a corrective reaction against the
superficial optimism diffused by the school of Rousseau. It was
the same optimism, with its easy methods of regenerating society
and its fatal blindness to the real conditions that circumscribe
human life, that was responsible for the wild theories of the
French Revolution and many of its consequent excesses.</p>

<p>The project of a formal and detailed treatise on population
was an afterthought of Malthus. The essay in which he had
studied a hypothetic future led him to examine the effects of
the principle he had put forward on the past and present state
of society; and he undertook an historical examination of these
effects, and sought to draw such inferences in relation to the
actual state of things as experience seemed to warrant. In its
original form he had spoken of no checks to population but those
which came under the head either of vice or of misery. In the
1803 edition he introduced the new element of the preventive
check supplied by what he calls &ldquo;moral restraint,&rdquo; and is thus
enabled to &ldquo;soften some of the harshest conclusions&rdquo; at which
he had before arrived. The treatise passed through six editions
in his lifetime, and in all of them he introduced various additions
and corrections. That of 1816 is the last he revised, and supplies
the final text from which it has since been reprinted.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the great development which he gave to his
work and the almost unprecedented amount of discussion to
which it gave rise, it remains a matter of some difficulty to discover
what solid contribution he has made to our knowledge,
nor is it easy to ascertain precisely what practical precepts, not
already familiar, he founded on his theoretic principles. This
twofold vagueness is well brought out in his celebrated correspondence
with Nassau Senior, in the course of which it seems
to be made apparent that his doctrine is new not so much in
its essence as in the phraseology in which it is couched. He
himself tells us that when, after the publication of the original
essay, the main argument of which he had deduced from David
Hume, Robert Wallace, Adam Smith and Richard Price, he
began to inquire more closely into the subject, he found that
&ldquo;much more had been done&rdquo; upon it &ldquo;than he had been aware
of.&rdquo; It had &ldquo;been treated in such a manner by some of the
French economists, occasionally by Montesquieu, and, among
English writers, by Dr Franklin, Sir James Steuart, Arthur
Young and Rev. J. Townsend, as to create a natural surprise
that it had not excited more of the public attention.&rdquo; &ldquo;Much,
however,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;remained yet to be done. The comparison
between the increase of population and food had not,
perhaps, been stated with sufficient force and precision,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;few inquiries had been made into the various modes by which
the level&rdquo; between population and the means of subsistence &ldquo;is
effected.&rdquo; The first desideratum here mentioned&mdash;the want,
namely, of an accurate statement of the relation between the
increase of population and food&mdash;Malthus doubtless supposed
to have been supplied by the celebrated proposition that &ldquo;population
increases in a geometrical, food in an arithmetical ratio.&rdquo;
This proposition, however, has been conclusively shown to be
erroneous, there being no such difference of law between the
increase of man and that of the organic beings which form his
food. When the formula cited is not used, other somewhat
nebulous expressions are sometimes employed, as, for example,
that &ldquo;population has a tendency to increase faster than food,&rdquo;
a sentence in which both are treated as if they were spontaneous
growths, and which, on account of the ambiguity of the word
&ldquo;tendency,&rdquo; is admittedly consistent with the fact asserted by
Senior, that food tends to increase faster than population. It
must always have been perfectly well known that population
will probably (though not necessarily) increase with every
augmentation of the supply of subsistence, and may, in some
instances, inconveniently press upon, or even for a certain time
exceed, the number properly corresponding to that supply.
Nor could it ever have been doubted that war, disease, poverty&mdash;the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page516" id="page516"></a>516</span>
last two often the consequences of vice&mdash;are causes which
keep population down. In fact, the way in which abundance,
increase of numbers, want, increase of deaths, succeed each other
in the natural economy, when reason does not intervene, had
been fully explained by Joseph Townsend in his <i>Dissertation on
the Poor Laws</i> (1786) which was known to Malthus. Again, it is
surely plain enough that the apprehension by individuals of the
evils of poverty, or a sense of duty to their possible offspring,
may retard the increase of population, and has in all civilized
communities operated to a certain extent in that way. It is
only when such obvious truths are clothed in the technical
terminology of &ldquo;positive&rdquo; and &ldquo;preventive checks&rdquo; that they
appear novel and profound; and yet they appear to contain
the whole message of Malthus to mankind. The laborious
apparatus of historical and statistical facts respecting the several
countries of the globe, adduced in the altered form of the essay,
though it contains a good deal that is curious and interesting,
establishes no general result which was not previously well known.</p>

<p>It would seem, then, that what has been ambitiously called
Malthus&rsquo;s theory of population, instead of being a great discovery
as some have represented it, or a poisonous novelty, as others
have considered it, is no more than a formal enunciation of
obvious, though sometimes neglected, facts. The pretentious
language often applied to it by economists is objectionable, as
being apt to make us forget that the whole subject with which
it deals is as yet very imperfectly understood&mdash;the causes which
modify the force of the sexual instinct, and those which lead to
variations in fecundity, still awaiting a complete investigation.</p>

<p>It is the law of diminishing returns from land, involving as it
does&mdash;though only hypothetically&mdash;the prospect of a continuously
increasing difficulty in obtaining the necessary sustenance
for all the members of a society, that gives the principal importance
to population as an economic factor. It is, in fact, the
confluence of the Malthusian ideas with the theories of Ricardo,
especially with the corollaries which the latter deduced from the
doctrine of rent (though these were not accepted by Malthus),
that has led to the introduction of population as an element in
the discussion of so many economic questions in modern times.</p>

<p>Malthus had undoubtedly the great merit of having called
public attention in a striking and impressive way to a subject
which had neither theoretically nor practically been sufficiently
considered. But he and his followers appear to have greatly
exaggerated both the magnitude and the urgency of the
dangers to which they pointed.<a name="fa1b" id="fa1b" href="#ft1b"><span class="sp">1</span></a> In their conceptions a single
social imperfection assumed such portentous dimensions that
it seemed to overcloud the whole heaven and threaten the world
with ruin. This doubtless arose from his having at first omitted
altogether from his view of the question the great counteracting
agency of moral restraint. Because a force exists, capable, if
unchecked, of producing certain results, it does not follow that
those results are imminent or even possible in the sphere of
experience. A body thrown from the hand would, under the
single impulse of projection, move for ever in a straight line; but
it would not be reasonable to take special action for the prevention
of this result, ignoring the fact that it will be sufficiently
counteracted by the other forces which will come into play. And
such other forces exist in the case we are considering. If the
inherent energy of the principle of population (supposed everywhere
the same) is measured by the rate at which numbers increase
under the most favourable circumstances, surely the force
of less favourable circumstances, acting through prudential or
altruistic motives, is measured by the great difference between
this maximum rate and those which are observed to prevail in
most European countries. Under a rational system of institutions,
the adaptation of numbers to the means available for their
support is effected by the felt or anticipated pressure of circumstances
and the fear of social degradation, within a tolerable
degree of approximation to what is desirable. To bring the
result nearer to the just standard, a higher measure of popular
enlightenment and more serious habits of moral reflection ought
indeed to be encouraged. But it is the duty of the individual
to his possible offspring, and not any vague notions as to the
pressure of the national population on subsistence, that will be
adequate to influence conduct.</p>

<p>It can scarcely be doubted that the favour which was at once
accorded to the views of Malthus in certain circles was due in
part to an impression, very welcome to the higher ranks of society,
that they tended to relieve the rich and powerful of responsibility
for the condition of the working classes, by showing that the
latter had chiefly themselves to blame, and not either the negligence
of their superiors or the institutions of the country. The
application of his doctrines, too, made by some of his successors
had the effect of discouraging all active effort for social improvement.
Thus Chalmers &ldquo;reviews <i>seriatim</i> and gravely sets aside
all the schemes usually proposed for the amelioration of the
economic condition of the people&rdquo; on the ground that an increase
of comfort will lead to an increase of numbers, and so the last
state of things will be worse than the first.</p>

<p>Malthus has in more modern times derived a certain degree of
reflected lustre from the rise and wide acceptance of the Darwinian
hypothesis. Its author himself, in tracing its filiation,
points to the phrase &ldquo;struggle for existence&rdquo; used by Malthus
in relation to the social competition. Darwin believed that man
advanced to his present high condition through such a struggle,
consequent on his rapid multiplication. He regarded, it is true,
the agency of this cause for the improvement of the race as
largely superseded by moral influences in the more advanced
social stages. Yet he considered it, even in these stages, of so
much importance towards that end that, notwithstanding the
individual suffering arising from the struggle for life, he deprecated
any great reduction in the natural, by which he seems
to mean the ordinary, rate of increase.</p>

<p>Besides his great work, Malthus wrote <i>Observations on the Effect

branch of the North Eastern railway. The town comprises Old
Malton and New Malton in the North Riding, and Norton on the
opposite side of the river Derwent, in the East Riding. Pop. of
urban district of Malton (1901), 4758; of urban district of Norton
3842. The situation, on the wooded hills rising from the narrow
valley, is very picturesque. The church of St Michael is a fine
late Norman building with perpendicular tower; the church of
St Leonard, of mixed architecture, with square tower and spire,
has three Norman arches and a Norman font. The church of
St Mary at Old Malton was attached to a Gilbertine priory
founded in 1150; it is transitional Norman and Early English,
with later insertions. Remains of the priory are scanty, but
include a crypt under a modern house. In the neighbourhood
of Malton are the slight but beautiful fragments of Kirkham
Abbey, an Early English Augustinian foundation of Walter
l&rsquo;Espec (1131); and the fine mansion of Castle Howard, a massive
building by Vanbrugh, the seat of the earls of Carlisle, containing
a noteworthy collection of pictures. Malton possesses a town-hall,
a corn exchange, a museum, and a grammar-school founded
in 1547. There are iron and brass foundries, agricultural implement
works, corn mills, tanneries and breweries. In the
neighbourhood are lime and whinstone quarries.</p>

<p>Traces of a Romano-British village exist on the east side of the
town, but there appears to be no history of Malton before the
Norman Conquest. The greater part of Malton belonged to
the crown in 1086 and was evidently retained until Henry I.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page517" id="page517"></a>517</span>
gave the castle and its appurtenances to Eustace son of John,
whose descendants took the name of Vescy. Eustace meditated
the deliverance of Malton Castle to King David of Scotland in
1138, but his plans were altered owing to the battle of the
Standard. The &ldquo;burgh&rdquo; of Malton is mentioned in 1187, and
in 1295 the town returned two members to parliament. It was
not represented again, however, until 1640, when an act was
passed to restore its ancient privileges. In 1867 the number
of members was reduced to one, and in 1885 the town was disfranchised.
Until the 17th century the burgesses had all the
privileges of a borough by prescriptive right, and were governed
by two bailiffs and two under-bailiffs, but these liberties were
taken from them in 1684 and have never been revived. From
that time a bailiff and two constables were appointed at the
court leet of the lord of the manor until a local board was formed
in 1854. In the 13th century Agnes de Vescy, then lady of the
manor, held a market in Malton by prescription, and Camden
writing about 1586 says that the lord of the manor then held two
weekly markets, on Tuesday and Saturday, the last being the
best cattle market in the county. The markets are now held
on Saturdays and alternate Tuesdays, and still belong to the lord
of the manor.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MALTZAN, HEINRICH VON,<a name="ar6" id="ar6"></a></span> <span class="sc">Baron zu Wartenburg und
Penzlin</span> (1826-1874), German traveller, was born on the
6th of September 1826 near Dresden. He studied law at Heidelberg,
but on account of ill health spent much of his time from
1850 in travel. Succeeding to his father&rsquo;s property in 1852,
he extended the range of his journeys to Morocco and other
parts of Barbary, and before his return home in 1854 had also
visited Egypt, Palestine and other countries of the Levant. In
1856-1857 he was again in Algeria; in 1858 he reached the
city of Morocco; and in 1860 he succeeded in performing
the pilgrimage to Mecca, which he afterwards described in
<i>Meine Wallfahrt nach Mecca</i> (Leipzig, 1865), but had to flee
for his life to Jidda without visiting Medina. He then visited
Aden and Bombay, and after some two years of study in Europe
again began to wander through the coasts and islands of the
Mediterranean, repeatedly visiting Algeria. His first book of
travel, <i>Drei Jahre im Nordwesten von Afrika</i> (Leipzig), appeared
in 1863, and was followed by a variety of works and essays,
popular and scientific. Maltzan&rsquo;s last book, <i>Reise nach Südarabien</i>
(Brunswick, 1873), is chiefly valuable as a digest of much
information about little-known parts of south Arabia collected
from natives during a residence at Aden in 1870-1871. Among
his other services to science must be noticed his collection of
Punic inscriptions (<i>Reise in Tunis und Tripolis</i>, Leipzig, 1870),
and the editing of Adolph von Wrede&rsquo;s remarkable journey in
Hadramut (<i>Reise in Hadramaut</i>, &amp;c., Brunswick, 1870). After
long suffering from neuralgia, Maltzan died by his own hand at
Pisa on the 23rd of February 1874.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MALUS, ÉTIENNE LOUIS<a name="ar7" id="ar7"></a></span> (1775-1812), French physicist, was
born at Paris on the 23rd of June 1775. He entered the military
engineering school at Mezières; but, being regarded as a suspected
person, he was dismissed without receiving a commission, and
obliged to enter the army as a private soldier. Being employed
upon the fortifications of Dunkirk, he attracted the notice of
the director of the works, and was selected as a member of the
École polytechnique then to be established under G. Monge.
After three years at the École he was admitted into the corps
of engineers, and served in the army of the Sambre and Meuse;
he was present at the passage of the Rhine in 1797, and at the
affairs of Ukratz and Altenkirch. In 1798 he joined the Egyptian
expedition and remained in the East till 1801. On his return
he held official posts successively at Antwerp, Strassburg and
Paris, and devoted himself to optical research. A paper published
in 1809 (&ldquo;Sur une propriété de la lumière réfléchie par les corps
diaphanes&rdquo;) contained the discovery of the polarization of light
by reflection, which is specially associated with his name, and
in the following year he won a prize from the Institute with his
memoir, &ldquo;Théorie de la double refraction de la lumière dans
les substances cristallines.&rdquo; He died of phthisis in Paris on the
23rd of February 1812.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MALVACEAE,<a name="ar8" id="ar8"></a></span> in botany, an order of Dicotyledons belonging
to the series Columniferae, to which belong also the orders Tiliaceae
(containing <i>Tilia</i>, the lime-tree), Bombaceae (containing
<i>Adansonia</i>, the baobab), Sterculiaceae (containing <i>Theobroma</i>,
cocoa, and <i>Colo</i>, cola-nut). It contains 39 genera with about 300
species, and occurs in all regions except the coldest, the number
of species increasing as we approach the tropics. It is represented
in Britain by three genera: <i>Malva</i>, mallow; <i>Althaea</i>,
marsh-mallow; and <i>Lavatera</i>, tree-mallow. The plants are herbs,
as in the British mallows, or, in the warmer parts of the earth,
shrubs or trees. The leaves are alternate and often palmately
lobed or divided; the stipules generally fall early. The leaves
and young shoots often bear stellate hairs and the tissues contain
mucilage-sacs. The regular, hermaphrodite, often showy flowers
are borne in the leaf-axils, solitary
or in fasicles, or form more
or less complicated cymose
arrangements. An epicalyx (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Mallow</a></span>, figs. 3, 4), formed by a
whorl of three or more bracteoles
is generally present just beneath
the calyx; sometimes, as in
<i>Abutilon</i>, it is absent. The
parts of the flowers are typically
in fives (fig. 1); the five sepals,
which have a valvate aestivation,
are succeeded by five often large
showy petals which are twisted
in the bud; they are free to the base, where they are attached
to the staminal tube and fall with it when the flower withers.
The very numerous stamens are regarded as arising from the
branching of a whorl of five opposite the petals; they are united
into a tube at the base, and bear kidney-shaped one-celled
anthers which open by a slit across the top (fig. 2). The large
spherical pollen-grains are covered
with spines. The carpels
are one to numerous; when five
in number, as in <i>Abutilon</i>, they
are opposite the petals, or, as in
<i>Hibiscus</i>, opposite the sepals.
In the British genera and many
others they are numerous,
forming a whorl round the top
of the axis in the centre of the
flower, the united styles rising
from the centre and bearing a
corresponding number of stigmatic
branches. In <i>Malope</i> the
numerous carpels are arranged one above the other in vertical
rows. One or more anatropous ovules are attached to the inner
angle of each carpel; they are generally ascending but sometimes
pendulous or horizontal; the position may vary, as in <i>Abutilon</i>,
in one and the same carpel.</p>

<p>The flowers are proterandrous; when the flower opens the
unripe stigmas are hidden in the staminal tube and the anthers
occupy the centre of the flower; as the anthers dehisce the filaments
bend backwards and finally the ripe stigmas spread in the
centre. Pollination is effected by insects which visit the flower
for the honey, which is secreted in pits one between the base of
each petal and is protected from rain by hairs on the lower
margin of the petals. In small pale-flowered forms, like <i>Malva
rotundifolia</i>, which attract few insects, self-pollination has been
observed, the style-arms twisting to bring the stigmatic surfaces
into contact with the anthers.</p>

<p>Except in <i>Malvaviscus</i> which has a berry, the fruits are dry.
In <i>Malva</i> (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Mallow</a></span>) and allied genera they form one-seeded
schizocarps separating from the persistent central column and
from each other. In <i>Hibiscus</i> and <i>Gossypium</i> (cotton-plant,
<i>q.v.</i>), the fruit is a capsule splitting loculicidally. Distribution
of the seeds is sometimes aided by hooked outgrowths on the
wall of the schizocarp, or by a hairy covering on the seed, an
extreme case of which is the cotton-plant where the seed is buried
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page518" id="page518"></a>518</span>
in a mass of long tangled hairs&mdash;the cotton. The embryo is
generally large with much-folded cotyledons and a small amount
of endosperm.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The largest genus, <i>Hibiscus</i>, contains 150 species, which are
widely distributed chiefly in the tropics; <i>H. rosasinensis</i> is a well-known
greenhouse plant. <i>Abutilon</i> (<i>q.v.</i>) contains 80 species,
mainly tropical; <i>Lavatera</i>, with 20 species, is chiefly Mediterranean;
<i>Althaea</i> has about 15 species in temperate and warm regions, <i>A.
rosea</i> being the hollyhock (<i>q.v.</i>); <i>Malva</i> has about 30 species in the
north-temperate zone. Several genera are largely or exclusively
American.</p>

<p><span class="bold" style="clear: both;">MALVASIA<a name="ar9" id="ar9"></a></span> (Gr. <i>Monemvasia</i>, <i>i.e.</i> the &ldquo;city of the single
approach or entrance&rdquo;; Ital. <i>Napoli di Malvasia</i>; Turk.
<i>Mengeshe</i> or <i>Beneshe</i>), one of the principal fortresses and commercial
centres of the Levant during the middle ages, still
represented by a considerable mass of ruins and a town of about
550 inhabitants. It stood on the east coast of the Morea, contiguous
to the site of the ancient Epidaurus Limera, of which
it took the place. So extensive was its trade in wine that the
name of the place became familiar throughout Europe as the
distinctive appellation of a special kind&mdash;Ital. <i>Malvasia</i>;
Span. <i>Malvagia</i>; Fr. <i>Malvoisie</i>; Eng. <i>Malvesie</i> or <i>Malmsey</i>.
The wine was not of local growth, but came for the most part
from Tenos and others of the Cyclades.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>As a fortress Malvasia played an important part in the struggles
between Byzantium, Venice and Turkey. The Byzantine emperors
considered it one of their most valuable posts in the Morea, and
rewarded its inhabitants for their fidelity by unusual privileges.
Phrantzes (Lib. IV. cap. xvi.) tells how the emperor Maurice made
the city (previously dependent in ecclesiastical matters on Corinth) a
metropolis or archbishop&rsquo;s see, and how Alexius Comnenus, and
more especially Andronicus II. (Palaeologus) gave the Monembasiotes
freedom from all sorts of exactions throughout the empire. It was
captured after a three years&rsquo; siege by Guillaume de Villehardouin
in 1248, but the citizens retained their liberties and privileges, and
the town was restored to the Byzantine emperors in 1262. After
many changes, it placed itself under Venice from 1463 to 1540,
when it was ceded to the Turks. In 1689 it was the only town of
the Morea which held out against Morosini, and Cornaro his successor
only succeeded in reducing it by famine. In 1715 it capitulated to
the Turks, and on the failure of the insurrection of 1770 the leading
families were scattered abroad. As the first fortress which fell into
the hands of the Greeks in 1821, it became in the following year the
seat of the first national assembly.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MALVERN,<a name="ar10" id="ar10"></a></span> an inland watering-place in the Bewdley parliamentary
division of Worcestershire, England, 128 m. W.N.W.
from London by the Great Western railway, served also by a
branch of the Midland railway from Ashchurch on the Bristol-Birmingham
line. Pop. of urban district(1901), 16,449. It is
beautifully situated on the eastern slopes of the Malvern Hills,
which rise abruptly from the flat valley of the Severn to a
height of 1395 ft. in the Worcestershire Beacon. The district
still bears the name of Malvern Chase, originally a Crown-land
and forest, though it was granted to the earldom of Gloucester
by Edward I. A ditch along the summit of the hills determined
the ancient boundary. Becoming a notorious haunt of criminals,
the tract was disafforested by Charles I., with the exception of
a portion known as the King&rsquo;s Chase, part of which is included
in the present common-land formed under the Malvern Hills Act
of 1884.</p>

<p>Malvern was in early times an important ecclesiastical settlement,
but its modern fame rests on its fine situation, pure
air, and chalybeate and bituminous springs. The open-air cure
for consumptive patients is here extensively practised.</p>

<p>The name Malvern is collectively applied to a line of small
towns and villages, extending along the foot of the hills for 5 m.
The principal is <span class="sc">Great Malvern</span>, lying beneath the Worcestershire
Beacon. It has a joint station of the Great Western and
Midland railways. Here was the Benedictine priory which arose
in 1083 out of a hermitage endowed by Edward the Confessor.
The priory church of SS. Mary and Michael is a fine cruciform
Perpendicular building, with an ornate central tower, embodying
the original Norman nave, and containing much early glass and
carved choir-stalls. The abbey gate and the refectory also
remain. There are here several hydropathic establishments,
and beautiful pleasure gardens. Malvern College, founded in
1862, is an important English public school. A museum is
attached to it. Mineral waters are manufactured. At <span class="sc">Malvern
Wells</span>, 2½ m. S., are the principal medicinal springs, also the
celebrated Holy Well, the water of which is of perfect purity.
There are extensive fishponds and hatcheries; and golf-links.
The Great Western railway has a station, and the Midland one
at Hanley Road. <span class="sc">Little Malvern</span> lies at the foot of the Herefordshire
Beacon, which is crowned by a British camp, 1½ m. S.
of Malvern Wells. There was a Benedictine priory here, of
which traces remain in the church. <span class="sc">Malvern Link</span>, 1 m. N.E.
of Great Malvern, of which it forms a suburb, has a station on
the Great Western railway. <span class="sc">West Malvern</span> and <span class="sc">North
Malvern</span>, named from their position relative to Great
Malvern, are pleasant residential quarters on the higher slopes
of the hills.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MALWA,<a name="ar11" id="ar11"></a></span> an historic province of India, which has given its
name to one of the political agencies into which Central India
is divided. Strictly, the name is confined to the hilly table-land,
bounded S. by the Vindhyan range, which drains N. into the
river Chambal; but it has been extended to include the Nerbudda
valley farther south. Its derivation is from the ancient tribe
of Malavas about whom very little is known, except that they
founded the Vikrama Samvat, an era dating from 57 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, which
is popularly associated with a mythical king Vikramaditya.
The earliest name of the tract seems to have been Avanti, from
its capital the modern Ujjain. The position of the Malwa or
Moholo mentioned by Hsuan Tsang (7th century) is plausibly
assigned to Gujarat. The first records of a local dynasty are
those of the Paramaras, a famous Rajput clan, who ruled for about
four centuries (800-1200), with their capital at Ujjain and afterwards
at Dhar. The Mahommedans invaded Malwa in 1235;
and in 1401 Dilawar Khan Ghori founded an independent kingdom,
which lasted till 1531. The greatest ruler of this dynasty
was Hoshang Shah (1405-1435), who made Mandu (<i>q.v.</i>) his capital
and embellished it with magnificent buildings. In 1562 Malwa
was annexed to the Mogul empire by Akbar. On the break-up
of that empire, Malwa was one of the first provinces to be conquered
by the Mahrattas. About 1743 the Mahratta peshwa
obtained from Delhi the title of governor, and deputed his
authority to three of his generals&mdash;Sindhia of Gwalior, Holkar
of Indore, and the Ponwar of Dhar who claims descent from the
ancient Paramaras. At the end of the 18th century Malwa
became a cockpit for fighting between the rival Mahratta powers,
and the headquarters of the Pindaris or irregular plunderers.
The Pindaris were extirpated by the campaign of Lord Hastings
in 1817, and the country was reduced to order by the energetic
rule of Sir John Malcolm. Malwa is traditionally the land of
plenty, in which sufferers from famine in the neighbouring
tracts always take refuge. But in 1899-1900 it was itself visited
by a severe drought, which seriously diminished the population,
and has since been followed by plague. The most valuable
product is opium.</p>

<p>The Malwa agency has an area of 8919 sq. m. with a population
(1901) of 1,054,753. It comprises the states of Dewas (senior
and junior branch), Jaora, Ratlam, Sitamau and Sailana, together
with a large portion of Gwalior, parts of Indore and Tonk,
and about 35 petty estates and holdings. The headquarters
of the political agent are at Nimach.</p>

<p>Malwa is also the name of a large tract in the Punjab, south
of the river Sutlej, which is one of the two chief homes of the
Sikhs, the other being known as Manjha. It includes the
British districts of Ferozpore and Ludhiana, together with the
native states of Patiala, Jind, Nabha and Maler Kotla.</p>

Rochelle. Pop. (1890), 2385; (1900) 3849; (1905) 5655; (1910)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page519" id="page519"></a>519</span>
5602. Mamaroneck is served by the New York, New Haven
&amp; Hartford railway. The township includes the village of
Larchmont (pop. in 1910, 1958), incorporated in 1891, and part
of the village of Mamaroneck (pop. in 1910, including the part
in Rye township, 5699), incorporated in 1895. Larchmont is
the headquarters of the Larchmont Yacht Club. The site of
Mamaroneck township was bought in 1660 from the Indians by
John Richbell, an Englishman, who obtained an English patent
to the tract in 1668. The first settlement was made by relatives
of his on the site of Mamaroneck village in 1676, and the township
was erected in 1788. On the 28th of August 1776, near Mamaroneck,
a force of American militiamen under Capt. John Flood
attacked a body of Loyalist recruits under William Lounsbury,
killing the latter and taking several prisoners. Soon afterwards
Mamaroneck was occupied by the Queen&rsquo;s Rangers under
Colonel Robert Rogers. On the night of the 21st of October
an attempt of a force of Americans under Colonel John Haslet
to surprise the Rangers failed, and the Americans, after a hand-to-hand
fight, withdrew with 36 prisoners. Mamaroneck was
the home of John Peter DeLancey (1753-1828), a Loyalist
soldier in the War of Independence, and was the birthplace of
his son William Heathcote DeLancey (1797-1865), a well-known
Protestant Episcopal clergyman, provost of the University of
Pennsylvania in 1827-1832 and bishop of western New York
from 1839 until his death. James Fenimore Cooper, the novelist,
married (1811) a daughter of John Peter DeLancey; lived in
Mamaroneck for several years, and here wrote his first novel,
<i>Precaution</i>, and planned <i>The Spy</i>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MAMELI, GOFFREDO<a name="ar13" id="ar13"></a></span> (1827-1849), Italian poet and patriot,
was born at Genoa of a noble Sardinian family. He received a
sound classical education at the Scolopi College, and later studied
law and philosophy at the university of Genoa. When nineteen
years old he corresponded with Mazzini, to whom he became
whole-heartedly devoted; among other patriotic poems he wrote
a hymn to the Bandiera brothers, and in the autumn of 1847
a song called &ldquo;Fratelli d&rsquo;Italia,&rdquo; which as Carducci wrote,
&ldquo;resounded through every district and on every battlefield of
the peninsula in 1848 and 1849.&rdquo; Mameli served in the National
Guard at Genoa, and then joined the volunteers in the Lombard
campaign of 1848, but after the collapse of the movement in
Lombardy he went to Rome, where the republic was proclaimed
and whence he sent the famous despatch to Mazzini: &ldquo;Roma!
Repubblica! Venite!&rdquo; At first he wrote political articles in
the newspapers, but when the French army approached the city
with hostile intentions he joined the fighting ranks and soon
won Garibaldi&rsquo;s esteem by his bravery. Although wounded in
the engagement of the 30th of April, he at once resumed his
place in the ranks, but on the 3rd of June he was again wounded
much more severely, and died in the Pellegrini hospital on the
6th of July 1849. Besides the poems mentioned above, he
wrote hymns to Dante, to the Apostles, &ldquo;Dio e popolo,&rdquo; &amp;c. The
chief merit of his work lies in the spontaneity and enthusiasm
for the Italian cause which rendered it famous, in spite of
certain technical imperfections, and he well deserved the epithet
of &ldquo;The Tyrtaeus of the Italian revolution.&rdquo;</p>

the produce had been vowed to Apollo (cf. <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Samnites</a></span>),
and to have settled first in Sicily near Tauromenium. An
inscription survives (R. S. Conway, <i>Italic Dialects</i>, 1) which
shows that they took with them the Oscan language as it was
spoken in Capua or Nola at that date, and the constitution
usual in Italic towns of a free community (<i>touta</i> =) governed by
two annual magistrates (<i>meddices</i>). The inscription dedicated
some large building (possibly a fortification) to Apollo, which so
far confirms the tradition just noticed. Though in the Oscan
language, the inscription is written in the Greek alphabet common
to south Italy from the 4th century <span class="scs">B.C.</span> onwards, viz. the
Tarentine Ionic, and so are the legends of two coins of much
the same date as the inscription (Conway, ib. 4). From 282
onwards (B. V. Head, <i>Historia numorum</i>, 136) the legend itself
is Graecized (<span class="grk" title="MAMERTINON">&#924;&#913;&#924;&#917;&#929;&#932;&#921;&#925;&#937;&#925;</span> instead of <span class="grk" title="MAAMERTINOUM">&#924;&#913;&#913;&#924;&#917;&#929;&#932;&#921;&#925;&#927;&#933;&#924;</span>)
which shows how quickly here, as everywhere, &ldquo;Graecia capta
ferum victorem cepit.&rdquo; On the Roman conquest of Sicily the
town secured an independence under treaty (Cicero, <i>Verr.</i> 3. 6.
13). The inhabitants were still called Mamertines in the time
of Strabo (vi. 2. 3).</p>

<p><span class="bold">M&#256;MERTINUS, CLAUDIUS<a name="ar16" id="ar16"></a></span> (4th century <span class="scs">A.D.</span>), one of the
Latin panegyrists. After the death of Julian, by whom he was
evidently regarded with special favour, he was praefect of Italy
(365) under Valens and Valentinian, but was subsequently (368)
deprived of his office for embezzlement. He was the author
of an extant speech of thanks to Julian for raising him to the
consulship, delivered on the 1st of January 362 at Constantinople.
Two panegyrical addresses (also extant) to Maximian
(emperor <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 286-305) are attributed to an older <i>magister</i>
Mamertinus, but it is probable that the corrupt MS. superscription
contains the word <i>memoriae</i>, and that they are
by an unknown <i>magister memoriae</i> (an official whose duty
consisted in communicating imperial rescripts and decisions
to the public). The first of these was delivered on the
birthday of Rome (April 21, 289), probably at Maximian&rsquo;s
palace at Augusta Trevirorum (Trèves), the second in 290 or
291, on the birthday of the emperor. By some they are
attributed to Eumenius (<i>q.v.</i>) who was a <i>magister memoriae</i>
and the author of at least one (if not more) panegyrics.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MAMIANI DELLA ROVERE, TERENZIO,<a name="ar17" id="ar17"></a></span> <span class="sc">Count</span> (1802-1885),
Italian writer and statesman, was born at Pesaro in 1799.
Taking part in the outbreaks at Bologna arising out of the
accession of Pope Gregory XVI., he was elected deputy for
Pesaro to the assembly, and subsequently appointed minister
of the interior; but on the collapse of the revolutionary movement
he was exiled. He returned to Italy after the amnesty
of 1846, and in 1848 he was entrusted with the task of
forming a ministry. He remained prime minister, however,
only for a few months, his political views being anything
but in harmony with those of the pope. He subsequently
retired to Genoa where he worked for Italian unity, was
elected deputy in 1856, and in 1860 became minister of
education under Cavour. In 1863 he was made minister
to Greece, and in 1865 to Switzerland, and later senator
and councillor of state. Meanwhile, he had founded at Genoa
in 1849 the Academy of Philosophy, and in 1855 had been
appointed professor of the history of philosophy at Turin; and
he published several volumes, not only on philosophical and
social subjects, but of poetry, among them <i>Rinnovamente della
filosofia antica italiana</i> (1836), <i>Teoria della Religione e dello stato</i>
(1869), <i>Kant e l&rsquo;ontologia</i> (1879), <i>Religione dell&rsquo; avenire</i> (1880),
<i>Di un nuovo diritto europeo</i> (1843, 1857). He died at Rome
on the 21st of May, 1885.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MAMMALIA<a name="ar18" id="ar18"></a></span> (from Lat. <i>mamma</i>, a teat or breast), the name
proposed by the Swedish naturalist Linnaeus for one of the
classes, or primary divisions, of vertebrated animals, the members
of which are collectively characterized by the presence in the
females of special glands secreting milk for the nourishment of
the young. With the exception of the lowest group, such
glands always communicate with the exterior by means of the
teats, nipples or mammae, from which the class derives its
name. The class-name (modified by the French into <i>Mammifères</i>,
and replaced in German by the practically equivalent
term <i>Säugethiere</i>) has been anglicized into &ldquo;Mammals&rdquo; (mammal,
in the singular). Of recent years, and more especially
in America, it has become a custom to designate the study of
mammals by the term &ldquo;mammalogy.&rdquo; Etymologically, however,
that designation cannot be justified; for it is of hybrid
(Latin and Greek) origin, and is equivalent to &ldquo;mastology,&rdquo; the
science which deals with the mammary gland (Gr. <span class="grk" title="mastos">&#956;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#972;&#962;</span>,
woman&rsquo;s breast), a totally different signification. As regards
existing forms of life, the limitations of the class are perfectly
well defined and easy of recognition; for although certain groups
(not, by the way, whales, which, although excluded in popular
estimation from the class, are in all essential respects typical
mammals) are exceedingly aberrant, and present structural
features connecting them with the lower vertebrate classes, yet
they are by common consent retained in the class to which they
are obviously most nearly affiliated by their preponderating
characteristics. There is thus at the present day a great
interval, unbridged by any connecting links, between mammals
and the other classes of vertebrates.</p>

<p>Not so, however, when the extinct forms of vertebrate life
are taken into consideration, for there is a group of reptiles from
the early part of the Secondary, or Mesozoic period, some of
whose members must have been so intimately related to mammals
that, were the whole group fully known, it would clearly be
impossible to draw a distinction between Mammalia on the one
hand and Reptilia on the other. Indeed, as it is, we are already
partially acquainted with one of these early intermediate
creatures (<i>Tritylodon</i>), which forms a kind of zoological shuttlecock,
being, so to speak, hit from one group to another, and
back again, by the various zoologists by whom its scanty remains
have been studied. Considered collectively, mammals, which
did not make their appearance on the earth for some time after
reptiles had existed, are certainly the highest group of the whole
vertebrate sub-kingdom. This expression must not, however,
be considered in too restricted a sense. In mammals, as in
other classes, there are low as well as high forms; but by any
tests that can be applied, especially those based on the state
of development of the central nervous system, it will be seen
that the average exceeds that of any other class, that many
species of this class far excel those of any other in perfection
of structure, and that it contains one form which is unquestionably
the culminating point amongst organized beings.</p>

<p>Mammals, then, are vertebrated animals, possessing the
normal characteristics of the members of that primary division
of the animal kingdom. They are separated from fishes and
batrachians (Pisces and Batrachians) on the one hand, and agree
with reptiles, and birds (Reptilia and Aves) on the other, in the
possession during intra-uterine life of the membranous vascular
structures respectively known as the amnion and the allantois,
and likewise in the absence at this or any other period of external
gills. A four-chambered heart, with a complete double circulation,
and warm blood (less markedly so in the lowest group
than in the rest of the class), distinguish mammals from existing
reptiles, although not from birds. From both birds and reptiles
the class is distinguished, so far at any rate as existing forms are
concerned, by the following features: the absence of a nucleus
in the red corpuscles of the blood, which are nearly always
circular in outline; the free suspension of the lungs in a thoracic
cavity, separated from the abdominal cavity by a muscular
partition, or diaphragm, which is the chief agent in inflating the
lungs in respiration; the aorta, or main artery, forming but a
single arch after leaving the heart, which curves over the left
terminal division of the windpipe, or bronchus; the presence
of more or fewer hairs on the skin and the absence of feathers;
the greater development of the bridge, or commissure, connecting
the two halves of the brain, which usually forms a complete
corpus callosum, or displays an unusually large size of its
anterior portion; the presence of a fully developed larynx at
the upper end of the trachea or windpipe, accompanied by the
absence of a syrinx, or expansion, near the lower end of the
same; the circumstance that each half of the lower jaw (except
perhaps at a very early stage of development) consists of a
single piece articulating posteriorly with the squamosal element
of the skull without the intervention of a separate quadrate
bone; the absence of prefrontal bones in the skull; the presence
of a pair of lateral knobs, or condyles (in place of a single median
one), on the occipital aspect of the skull for articulation with
the first vertebra; and, lastly, the very obvious character of the
female being provided with milk-glands, by the secretion of
which the young (produced, except in the very lowest group,
alive and not by means of externally hatched eggs) are nourished
for some time after birth.</p>

<p>In the majority of mammals both pairs of limbs are well
developed and adapted for walking or running. The fore-limbs
may, however, be modified, as in moles, for burrowing, or, as in
bats, for flight, or finally, as in whales and dolphins, for swimming,
with the assumption in this latter instance of a flipper-like
form and the complete disappearance of the hind-limbs. Special
adaptations for climbing are exhibited by both pairs of limbs
in opossums, and for hanging to boughs in sloths. In no instance
are the fore-limbs wanting.</p>

<p>In the great majority of mammals the hind extremity of the
axis of the body is prolonged into a tail. Very generally the
tail has distinctly the appearance of an appendage, but in some
of the lower mammals, such as the thylacine among marsupials,
and the aard-vark or ant-bear among the edentates, it is much
thickened at the root, and passes insensibly into the body, after
the fashion common among reptiles. As regards function, the
tail may be a mere pendent appendage, or may be adapted to
grasp boughs in climbing, or even to collect food or materials
for a nest or sleeping place, as in the spider-monkeys, opossums
and rat-kangaroos. Among jumping animals it may serve as
a balance, as in the case of jerboas and kangaroos, while in
the latter it is also used as a support when resting; among many
hoofed mammals it is used as a fly-whisk; and in whales and
dolphins, as well as in the African <i>Potamogale</i> and the North
American musquash, it plays an important part in swimming.
Its supposed use as a trowel by the beaver is, however, not
supported by the actual facts of the case.</p>

<p>As already indicated, the limbs of different mammals are
specially modified for various modes of life; and in many cases
analogous modifications occur, in greater or less degree, throughout
the entire body. Those modifications most noticeable in
the case of cursorial types may be briefly mentioned as examples.
In this case, as might be expected, the greatest modifications
occur in the limbs, but correlated with this is also an elongation
of the head and neck in long-legged types. Adaptation for
speed is further exhibited in the moulding of the shape of the
body so as to present the minimum amount of resistance to the
air, as well as in increase in heart and lung capacity to meet
the extra expenditure of energy. Finally, in the jumping forms
we meet with an increase in the length and weight of the tail,
which has to act as a counterpoise. As regards the feet, a
reduction in the number of digits from the typical five is a
frequent feature, more especially among the hoofed mammals,
where the culmination in this respect is attained by the existing
members of the horse tribe and certain representatives of the
extinct South American <i>Proterotheriidae</i>, both of which are
monodactyle. Brief reference may also be made to the morphological
importance of extraordinary length or shortness in the
skulls of mammals&mdash;dolichocephalism and brachycephalism;
both these features being apparently characteristic of specialized
types, the former condition being (as in the horse) often, although
not invariably, connected with length of limb and neck, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page521" id="page521"></a>521</span>
adaptation to speed, while brachycephalism may be correlated
with short limbs and an abbreviated neck. Exceptions to this
rule, as exemplified by the cats, are due to special adaptive
causes. In point of bodily size mammals present a greater range
of variation than is exhibited by any other living terrestrial
animals, the extremes in this respect being displayed by the
African elephant on the one hand and certain species of shrew-mice
(whose head and body scarcely exceed an inch and a half
in length) on the other. When the aquatic members of the class
are taken into consideration, the maximum dimensions are
vastly greater, Sibbald&rsquo;s rorqual attaining a length of fully
80 ft., and being probably the bulkiest and heaviest animal
that has ever existed. Within the limits of individual groups,
it may be accepted as a general rule that increase in bulk or
stature implies increased specialization; and, further, that the
largest representatives of any particular group are also approximately
the latest. The latter dictum must not, however, be
pushed to an extreme, since the African elephant, which is the
largest living land mammal, attaining in exceptional cases a
height approaching 12 ft., was largely exceeded in this respect
by an extinct Indian species, whose height has been estimated
at between 15 and 16 ft.</p>

<p>In regard to sense-organs, ophthalmoscopic observations on
the eyes of living mammals (other than man) have revealed the
existence of great variation in the arrangement of the blood-vessels,
as well as in the colour of the retina; blue and violet
seem to be unknown, while red, yellow and green form the
predominating shades. In the main, the various types of
minute ocular structure correspond very closely to the different
groups into which mammals are divided, this correspondence
affording important testimony in the favour of the general
correctness of the classification. Among the exceptions are the
South American squirrel-monkeys, whose eyes approximate in
structure to those of the lemurs. Man and monkeys alone
possess parallel and convergent vision of the two eyes, while a
divergent, and consequently a very widely extended, vision is a
prerogative of the lower mammals; squirrels, for instance, and
probably also hares and rabbits, being able to see an object
approaching them directly from behind without turning their
heads.</p>

<p>An osteological question which has been much discussed is
the fate of the reptilian quadrate bone in the mammalian skull.
In the opinion of F. W. Thyng, who has carefully reviewed all
the other theories, the balance of evidence tends to show that
the quadrate has been taken up into the inner ear, where it is
represented among the auditory ossicles by the incus.</p>

<p>Although the present article does not discuss mammalian
osteology in general (for which see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Vertebrata</a></span>), it is interesting
to notice in this connexion that the primitive condition of the
mammalian tympanum apparently consisted merely of a small
and incomplete bony ring, with, at most, an imperfect ventral
wall to the tympanic cavity, and that a close approximation to
this original condition still persists in the monotremes, especially
<i>Ornithorhynchus</i>. The tympano-hyal is the characteristic mammalian
element in this region; but the entotympanic likewise
appears to be peculiar to the class, and to be unrepresented
among the lower vertebrates. The tympanum itself has been
regarded as representing one of the elements&mdash;probably the
supra-angular&mdash;of the compound reptilian lower jaw. The
presence of only seven vertebrae in the neck is a very constant
feature among mammals; the exceptions being very few.</p>

<p>Two other points in connexion with mammalian osteology
may be noticed. A large number of mammals possess a perforation,
or foramen, on the inner side of the lower end of the
humerus, and also a projection on the shaft of the femur known
as the third trochanter. From its occurrence in so many of the
lower vertebrates, the entepicondylar foramen of the humerus,
as it is called, is regarded by Dr E. Stromer as a primitive
structure, of which the original object was to protect certain
nerves and blood-vessels. It is remarkable that it should persist
in the spectacled bear of the Andes, although it has disappeared
in all other living members of the group. The third trochanter
of the femur, on the other hand, can scarcely be regarded as
primitive, seeing that it is absent in several of the lower groups
of mammals. Neither can its presence be attributed, as Professor
A. Gaudry suggests, to the reduction in the number of the toes,
as otherwise it should not be found in the rhinoceros. Its
general absence in man forbids the idea of its having any connexion
with the upright posture.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Hair.</i>&mdash;In the greater number of mammals the skin is more
or less densely clothed with a peculiarly modified form of epidermis
known as hair. This consists of hard, elongated, slender, cylindrical
or tapering, thread-like masses of epidermic tissue, each of which
grows, without branching, from a short prominence, or papilla, sunk
at the bottom of a pit, or follicle, in the true skin, or dermis. Such
hairs, either upon different parts of the skin of the same species, or
in different species, assume very diverse forms and are of various
sizes and degrees of rigidity&mdash;as seen in the fur of the mole, the
bristles of the pig, and the spines of the hedgehog and porcupine,
which are all modifications of the same structures. These differences
arise mainly from the different arrangement of the constituent
elements into which the epidermal cells are modified. Each hair is
composed usually of a cellular pithy internal portion, containing
much air, and a denser or more horny external or cortical part.
In some mammals, as deer, the substance of the hair is almost entirely
composed of the central medullary or cellular substance, and is
consequently very easily broken; in others the horny part prevails
almost exclusively, as in the bristles of the wild boar. In the three-toed
sloth (<i>Bradypus</i>) the hairs have a central horny axis and a
pithy exterior. Though generally nearly smooth, or but slightly
scaly, the surface of some hairs is imbricated; that is to say, shows
projecting scale-like processes, as in some bats, while in the two-toed
sloth (<i>Choloepus</i>) they are longitudinally grooved or fluted.
Though usually more or less cylindrical or circular in section, hairs
are often elliptical or flattened, as in the curly-haired races of men,
the terminal portion of the hair of moles and shrews, and conspicuously
in the spines of the spiny squirrels of the genus <i>Xerus</i> and
those of the mouse-like <i>Platacanthomys</i>. Hair having a property
of mutual cohesion or &ldquo;felting,&rdquo; which depends upon a roughened
scaly surface and a tendency to curl, as in domestic sheep, is called
&ldquo;wool.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It has been shown by J. C. H. de Meijere that the insertion
of the individual hairs in the skin displays a definite arrangement,
constant for each species, but varying in different groups. In
jerboas, for example, a bunch of twelve or thirteen hairs springs
from the same point, while in the polar bear a single stout hair
and several slender ones arise together, and in the marmosets three
equal-sized hairs form regular groups. These tufts or groups likewise
display an orderly and definite grouping in different mammals,
which suggests the origin of such groups from the existence in primitive
mammals of a scaly coat comparable to that of reptiles, and
indeed directly inherited therefrom.</p>

<p>In a large proportion of mammals there exist hairs of two distinct
types: the one long, stiff, and alone appearing on the surface, and
the other shorter, finer and softer, constituting the under-fur,
which may be compared to the down of birds. A well-known
example is furnished by the fur-bearing seals, in which the outer
fur is removed in the manufacture of commercial &ldquo;seal-skin,&rdquo;
leaving only the soft and fine under-fur.</p>

<p>Remarkable differences in the direction or slope of the hair are
noticeable on different parts of the body and limbs of many mammals,
especially in certain apes, where the hair of the fore-limbs is inclined
towards the elbow from above and from below. More remarkable
still is the fact that the direction of the slope often differs in closely
allied groups, as, for instance, in African and Asiatic buffaloes, in
which the hair of the middle line of the back has opposite directions.
Whorls of hair, as on the face of the horse and the South American
deer known as brockets, occur where the different hair-slopes meet.
In this connexion reference may be made to patches or lines of long
and generally white hairs situated on the back of certain ruminants,
which are capable of erection during periods of excitement, and
serve, apparently, as &ldquo;flags&rdquo; to guide the members of a herd in
flight. Such are the white chrysanthemum-like patches on the
rump of the Japanese deer and of the American prong-buck (<i>Antilocapra</i>),
and the line of hairs situated in a groove on the loins of the
African spring-buck. The white underside of the tail of the
rabbit and the yellow rump-patch of many deer are analogous.</p>

<p>The eye-lashes, or <i>ciliae</i>, are familiar examples of a special local
development of hair. Special tufts of stout stiff hairs, sometimes
termed <i>vibrissae</i>, and connected with nerves, and in certain cases
with glands, occur in various regions. They are most common on
the head, while they constitute the &ldquo;whiskers,&rdquo; or &ldquo;feelers,&rdquo; of the
cats and many rodents. In other instances, notably in the lemurs,
but also in certain carnivora, rodents and marsupials, they occupy
a position on the fore-arm near the wrist, in connexion with glands,
and receive sensory powers from the radial nerve. In some mammals
the hairy covering is partial and limited to particular regions; in
others, as the hippopotamus and the sea-cows, or Sirenia, though
scattered over the whole surface, it is extremely short and scanty;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page522" id="page522"></a>522</span>
but in none is it reduced to so great an extent as in the Cetacea, in
which it is limited to a few small bristles confined to the neighbourhood
of the lips and nostrils, and often present only in the young,
or even the foetal condition.</p>

<p>Some kinds of hairs, as those of the mane and tail of the horse,
persist throughout life, but more generally, as in the case of the
body-hair of the same animal, they are shed and renewed periodically,
generally annually. Many mammals have a longer hairy
coat in winter, which is shed as summer comes on; and some few,
which inhabit countries covered in winter with snow, as the Arctic
fox, variable hare and ermine, undergo a complete change of colour
in the two seasons, being white in winter and grey or brown in
summer. There has been much discussion as to whether this
winter whitening is due to a change in the colour of the individual
hairs or to a change of coat. It has, however, been demonstrated
that the senile whitening of human hair is due to the presence of
phagocytes, which devour the pigment-bodies; and from microscopic
observations recently made by the French naturalist Dr E. Trouessart,
it appears that much the same kind of action takes place in the hairs
of mammals that turn white in winter. Cold, by some means or
other, causes the pigment-bodies to shift from the normal positions,
and to transfer themselves to other layers of the hair, where they
are attacked and devoured by phagocytes. The winter whitening
of mammals is, therefore, precisely similar to the senile bleaching
of human hair, no shift of the coat taking place. Under the influence
of exposure to intense cold a small mammal has been observed
to turn white in a single night, just as the human hair has been
known to blanch suddenly under the influence of intense emotion,
and in both cases extreme activity of the phagocytes is apparently
the inducing cause. The African golden-moles (<i>Chrysochloris</i>),
the desmans or water-moles (<i>Myogale</i>), and the West African
<i>Potamogale velox</i>, are remarkable as being the only mammals whose
hair reflects those iridescent tints so common in the feathers of
tropical birds.</p>

<p>The principal and most obvious purpose of the hairy covering is
to protect the skin. Its function in the hairless Cetacea is discharged
by the specially modified and thickened layer of fatty
tissue beneath the skin known as &ldquo;blubber.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Scales, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;True scales, or flat imbricated plates of horny
material, covering the greater part of the body, are found in one
family only of mammals, the pangolins or <i>Manidae</i>; but these are
also associated with hairs growing from the intervals between the
scales or on the parts of the skin not covered by them. Similarly
imbricated epidermic productions form the covering of the under-surface
of the tail of the African flying rodents of the family <i>Anomaluridae</i>;
and flat scutes, with the edges in apposition, and not overlaid,
clothe both surfaces of the tail of the beaver, rats and certain
other members of the rodent order, and also of some insectivora
and marsupials. Armadillos alone possess an external bony
skeleton, composed of plates of bony tissue, developed in the skin
and covered with scutes of horny epidermis. Other epidermic
appendages are the horns of ruminants and rhinoceroses&mdash;the former
being elongated, tapering, hollow caps of hardened epidermis of
fibrous structure, fitting on and growing from conical projections
of the frontal bones and always arranged in pairs, while the latter
are of similar structure, but without any internal bony support,
and situated in the middle line. Callosities, or bare patches covered
with hardened and thickened epidermis, are found on the buttocks
of many apes, the breast of camels, the inner side of the limbs of
<i>Equidae</i>, the grasping under-surface of the tail of prehensile-tailed
monkeys, opossums, &amp;c. The greater part of the skin of the one-horned
Asiatic rhinoceros is immensely thickened and stiffened by
an increase of the tissue of both the skin and epidermis, constituting
the well-known jointed &ldquo;armour-plated&rdquo; hide of those animals.</p>

<p><i>Nails, Claws and Hoofs.</i>&mdash;With few exceptions, the terminal
extremities of the digits of both limbs of mammals are more or less
protected or armed by epidermic plates or sheaths, constituting the
various forms of nails, claws or hoofs. These are absent in the
Cetacea alone. A perforated spur, with a special secreting gland
in connexion with it, is found attached to each hind-leg of the males
of the existing species of Monotremata.</p>

<p><i>Scent-glands, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;Besides the universally distributed sweat-glands
connected with the hair-system, most mammals have special
glands in modified portions of the skin, often involuted to form a
shallow recess or a deep sac with a narrow opening, situated in
various parts of the surface of the body, and secreting odorous
substances, by the aid of which individuals recognize one another.
These probably afford the principal means by which wild animals
are able to become aware of the presence of other members of the
species, even at great distances.</p>

<p>To this group of structures belong the suborbital face-gland,
&ldquo;larmier,&rdquo; or &ldquo;crumen,&rdquo; of antelopes and deer, the frontal gland
of the muntjak and of bats of the genus <i>Phyllorhina</i>, the chin-gland
of the chevrotains and of <i>Taphozous</i> and certain other bats,
the glandular patch behind the ear of the chamois and the reed-buck,
the glands on the lower parts of the legs of most deer and a
few antelopes (the position of which is indicated by tufts of long
and often specially coloured hair), the interdigital foot-glands of
goats, sheep, and many other ruminants, the temporal gland of
elephants, the lateral glands of the musk-shrew, the gland on the
back of the hyrax and the peccary (from the presence of which the
latter animal takes the name <i>Dicotyles</i>), the gland on the tails of
the members of the dog-tribe, the preputial glands of the musk-deer
and beaver (both well known for the use made of their powerfully
odorous secretion in perfumery), and also of the swine and
hare, the anal glands of Carnivora, the perineal gland of the civet
(also of commercial value), the caudal glands of the fox and goat,
the gland on the wing-membrane of bats of the genus <i>Saccopteryx</i>,
the post-digital gland of the rhinoceros, &amp;c. Very generally these
glands are common to both sexes, and it is in such cases that their
function as a means of mutual recognition is most evident. It has
been suggested that the above-mentioned callosities or &ldquo;chestnuts&rdquo;
on the limbs of horses are vestigial scent-glands; and it is noteworthy
that scrapings or shavings from their surface have a
powerful attraction for other horses, and are also used by poachers
and burglars to keep dogs silent. The position of such glands on the
lower portions of the limbs is plainly favourable to a recognition-taint
being left in the tracks of terrestrial animals; and antelopes
have been observed deliberately to rub the secretion from their
face-glands on tree-trunks. When glands are confined to the male,
their function is no doubt sexual; the secretion forming part of
the attraction, or stimulus, to the other sex.</p>

<p class="pt2"><i>Dentition.</i>&mdash;In the great majority of mammals the teeth form a
definite series, of which the hinder elements are of a more or less
complex type, while those in front are simpler. With the exception
of the marsupials, a set of deciduous, or milk, teeth is developed in
most mammals with a complicated type of dentition; these milk-teeth
being shed at a comparatively early period (occasionally even
<i>in utero</i>), when they are succeeded by the larger permanent series,
which is the only other ever developed. This double series of
teeth thus forms a very characteristic feature of mammals generally.
Both the milk and the permanent dentition display the aforesaid
complexity of the hinder teeth as compared with those in front,
and since the number of milk-teeth is always considerably less
than that of the permanent set, it follows that the hinder milk-teeth
are usually more complex than the teeth of which they are
the predecessors in the permanent series, and represent functionally,
not their immediate successors, but those more posterior permanent
teeth which have no direct predecessors. This character is clearly
seen in those animals in which the various members of the lateral
or cheek series are well differentiated from each other in form, as
the Carnivora, and also in man.</p>

<p>In mammals with two sets of teeth the number of those of the
permanent series preceded by milk-teeth varies greatly, being
sometimes, as in marsupials and some rodents, as few as one on
each side of each jaw, and in other cases including the larger portion
of the series. As a rule, the teeth of the two sides of the jaws are
alike in number and character, except in cases of accidental or
abnormal variation, and in the tusks of the narwhal, in which the
left is of immense size, and the right rudimentary. In mammals,
such as dolphins and some armadillos, which have a large series of
similar teeth, not always constant in number in different individuals,
there may indeed be differences in the two sides; but, apart from
these in describing the dentition of any mammal, it is generally
sufficient to give the number and characters of the teeth of one side
only. As the teeth of the upper and the lower jaws work against
each other in masticating, there is a general correspondence or
harmony between them, the projections of one series, when the
mouth is closed, fitting into corresponding depressions of the other.
There is also a general resemblance in the number, characters and
mode of succession of both series; so that, although individual
teeth of the upper and lower jaws may not be in the strict sense of
the term homologous parts, there is a great convenience in applying
the same descriptive terms to the one which are used for the other.</p>

<p>The simplest dentition is that of many species of dolphin (fig. 1),
in which the crowns are single-pointed, slightly curved cones, and
the roots also single and tapering; so that all the teeth are alike in
form from the anterior to the posterior end of the series, though it
may be with some slight difference in size, those at the two extremities
being rather smaller than the others. Such a dentition
is called &ldquo;homoeodont&rdquo; (Gr. <span class="grk" title="homoios">&#8004;&#956;&#959;&#953;&#959;&#962;</span>, like, <span class="grk" title="odous">&#8000;&#948;&#959;&#973;&#962;</span>, tooth), and in the
case cited, as the teeth are never changed, it is also monophyodont
(Gr. <span class="grk" title="monos">&#956;&#972;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span>, alone, single, <span class="grk" title="phyein">&#966;&#973;&#949;&#953;&#957;</span>, to generate, <span class="grk" title="odous">&#8000;&#948;&#959;&#973;&#962;</span>, tooth). Such
teeth are adapted only for catching slippery living prey, like fish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page523" id="page523"></a>523</span></p>

<p>In a very large number of mammals the teeth of different parts
of the series are more or less differentiated in character; and, accordingly,
have different functions to perform. The front teeth are
simple and one-rooted, and are adapted for cutting and seizing.
They are called &ldquo;incisors.&rdquo; The back, lateral or cheek teeth, on
the other hand, have broader and more complex crowns, tuberculated
or ridged, and supported on two or more roots. They
crush or grind the food, and are hence called &ldquo;molars.&rdquo; Many
mammals have, between these two sets, a tooth at each corner of
the mouth, longer and more pointed than the others, adapted for
tearing or stabbing, or for fixing struggling prey. From the conspicuous
development of such teeth in the Carnivora, especially
the dogs, they have received the name of &ldquo;canines.&rdquo; A dentition
with its component parts so differently formed that these distinctive
terms are applicable to them is called heterodont (Gr. <span class="grk" title="heteros">&#7957;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#962;</span>,
different). In most cases, though by no means invariably, mammals
with a heterodont dentition are also diphyodont (Gr. <span class="grk" title="diphyês">&#948;&#953;&#966;&#965;&#942;&#962;</span>, of
double form).</p>

(II.) Jaws of the Dog (<i>Canis</i>), with the symbols by which the different

wanting to complete the typical heterodont mammalian dentition.</td></tr></table>

<p class="pt2">This general arrangement is obvious in a considerable number
of mammals; and examination shows that, under great modifications
in detail, there is a remarkable uniformity of essential characters
in the dentition of a large number of members of the class belonging
to different orders and not otherwise closely allied, so much that it
is possible to formulate a common plan of dentition from which the
others have been derived by the alteration of some and the suppression
of other members of the series, and occasionally, but very
rarely, by addition. In this generalized form of mammalian
dentition the total number of teeth present is 44, or 11 above and
11 below on each side. Those of each jaw are placed in continuous
series without intervals between them; and, although the anterior
teeth are simple and single-rooted, and the posterior teeth complex
and with several roots, the transition between the two kinds is
gradual.</p>

<p>In dividing and grouping such teeth for the purpose of description
and comparison more definite characters are required than those
derived merely from form or function. The first step towards a
classification rests on the fact that the upper jaw is composed of
two bones, the premaxilla and the maxilla, and that the division
or suture between these bones separates the three front teeth from
the rest. These three teeth, which are implanted in the premaxilla,
form a distinct group, to which the name of &ldquo;incisor&rdquo; is applied.
This distinction is, however, not so important as it appears at first
sight, for their connexion with the bone is only of a secondary nature,
and, although it happens conveniently that in the great majority
of cases the division between the bones coincides with the interspace
between the third and fourth tooth of the series, still, when
it does not, as in the mole, too much weight must not be given to
this fact, if it contravenes other reasons for determining the homologies
of the teeth. The eight remaining teeth of the upper jaw
offer a natural division, inasmuch as the three hindmost never have
milk-predecessors; and, although some of the anterior teeth may be
in the same case, the particular one preceding these three always
has such a predecessor. These three, then, are grouped as the
&ldquo;molars.&rdquo; Of the five teeth between the incisors and molars the
most anterior, or the one usually situated close behind the pre-maxillary
suture, very generally assumes a lengthened and pointed
form, and constitutes the &ldquo;canine&rdquo; of the Carnivora, the tusk of
the boar, &amp;c. It is customary, therefore, to call this tooth, whatever
its size or form, the &ldquo;canine.&rdquo; The remaining four are the
&ldquo;premolars.&rdquo; This system has been objected to as artificial, and
in many cases not descriptive, the distinction between premolars
and canine especially being sometimes not obvious; but the terms
are now in such general use, and also so convenient, that it is not
likely they will be superseded. It is frequently convenient to refer
to all the teeth behind the canine as the &ldquo;cheek-teeth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With regard to the lower teeth the difficulties are greater, owing
to the absence of any suture corresponding to that which defines
the incisors above; but since the number of the teeth is the same,
since the corresponding teeth are preceded by milk-teeth, and since
in the large majority of cases it is the fourth tooth of the series
which is modified in the same way as the canine (or fourth tooth)
of the upper jaw, it is reasonable to adopt the same divisions as
with the upper series, and to call the first three, which are implanted
in the part of the mandible opposite to the premaxilla, the incisors,
the next the canine, the next four the premolars, and the last three
the molars.</p>

<p>It may be observed that when the mouth is closed, especially
when the opposed surfaces of the teeth present an irregular outline,
the corresponding upper and lower teeth are not exactly opposite,
otherwise the two series could not fit into one another, but as a rule
the points of the lower teeth shut into the interspaces in front of the
corresponding teeth of the upper jaw. This is very distinct in the
canine teeth of the Carnivora, and is a useful guide in determining
the homologies of the teeth of the two jaws.</p>

<p>For the sake of brevity the complete dentition is described by the
following formula, the numbers above the line representing the teeth
of the upper, those below the line those of the lower jaw:
incisors (3&mdash;3)/(3&mdash;3), canines (1&mdash;1)/(1&mdash;1), premolars (4&mdash;4)/(4&mdash;4), molars, (3&mdash;3)/(3&mdash;3) = (11&mdash;11)/(11&mdash;11) total 44.
As, however, initial letters may be substituted for the names of each
group, and it is unnecessary to give more than the numbers of the
teeth on one side of the mouth, the formula may be abbreviated into:</p>

<p class="center"><i>i</i> <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>, <i>c</i> <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">1</span>, <i>p</i> <span class="spp">4</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">4</span>, <i>m</i> <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>; total 44.</p>

<p>The individual teeth of each group are enumerated from before
backwards, and by such a formula as the following:&mdash;</p>

<table class="math0" summary="math">
<tr><td><i>i</i> 1, <i>i</i> 2, <i>i</i> 3, <i>c</i>, <i>p</i> 1, <i>p</i> 2, <i>p</i> 3, <i>p</i> 4, <i>m</i> 1, <i>m</i> 2, <i>m</i> 3
</td>
<td rowspan="2"></td></tr>
<tr><td class="denom"><i>i</i> 1, <i>i</i> 2, <i>i</i> 3, <i>c</i>, <i>p</i> 1, <i>p</i> 2, <i>p</i> 3, <i>p</i> 4, <i>m</i> 1, <i>m</i> 2, <i>m</i> 3</td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">a special numerical designation is given by which each one can be
indicated. In mentioning any single tooth, such a sign as <span class="un f80">m1</span> will
mean the first upper molar, <span class="ov f80">m1</span> the first lower molar, and so on.</p>

<p>When, as is the case among nearly all existing mammals with the
exception of the members of the genera <i>Sus</i> (pigs), <i>Gymnura</i> (rat-shrew),
<i>Talpa</i> (moles) and <i>Myogale</i> (desmans) the number of teeth
is reduced below the typical forty-four, it appears to be an almost
universal rule that if one of the incisors is missing it is the second,
or middle one, while the premolars commence to disappear from the
front end of the series and the molars from the hinder end.</p>

<p>The milk-dentition is expressed by a similar formula, <i>d</i> for deciduous,
being added before the letter expressive of the nature of the
tooth. As the three molars and (almost invariably) the first premolar
of the permanent series have no predecessors, the typical
milk-dentition would be expressed as follows: <i>di</i> <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span>, <i>dc</i> <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">1</span>, <i>dm</i> <span class="spp">3</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">3</span> = 28.
The teeth which precede the premolars of the permanent series are
called either milk-molar or milk-premolar. When there is a marked
difference between the premolars and molars of the permanent
dentition, the first milk-molar resembles a premolar, while the last
has the characters of the posterior molar. It is sometimes convenient
to refer to all the seven cheek-teeth as members of a single continuous
series (which they undoubtedly are), and for this purpose the following
nomenclature has been proposed:&mdash;</p>

<p>With the exception of the Cetacea, most of the Edentata, and the
Sirenia, in which the teeth, when present, have been specialized
in a retrograde or aberrant manner, the placental mammals as
a whole have a dentition conforming more or less closely to the
foregoing type.</p>

<p>With the marsupials the case is, however, somewhat different;
the whole number not being limited to 44, owing largely to the fact
that the number of upper incisors may exceed three pairs, reaching
indeed in some instances to as many as five. Moreover, with the
exception of the wombats, the number of pairs of incisors in the upper
always exceeds those in the lower. When fully developed, the
number of cheek-teeth is, however, seven; and it is probable that, as
in placentals, the first four of these are premolars and the remaining
three molars, although it was long held that these numbers should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page524" id="page524"></a>524</span>
be transposed. The most remarkable feature about the marsupial
dentition is that, at most, only a single pair of teeth is replaced in
each jaw; this pair, on the assumption that there are four premolars,
representing the third of that series. With the exception of this
replacing pair of teeth in each jaw, it is considered by many authorities
that the marsupial dentition corresponds to the deciduous, or
milk, dentition of placentals. If this be really the case, the rudiments
of an earlier set of teeth which have been detected in the jaws
of some members of the order, represent, not the milk-series, but a
prelacteal dentition. On the assumption that these functional
teeth correspond to the milk-series of placentals, marsupials in
this respect agree exactly with modern elephants, in which the same
peculiarity exists.</p>

<p>In very few mammals are teeth entirely absent. Even in the
whalebone whales their germs are formed in the same manner and
at the same period of life as in other mammals, and even become
partially calcified, although they never rise above the gums, and completely
disappear before birth. In the American anteaters and the
pangolins among the Edentata no traces of teeth have been found
at any age. Adult monotremes are in like case, although the duck-billed
platypus (<i>Ornithorhynchus</i>) has teeth when young on the sides
of the jaws. The northern sea-cow (<i>Rhytina</i>), now extinct, appears
to have been toothless throughout life.</p>

<p>In different groups of mammals the dentition is variously specialized
in accordance with the nature of the food on which the members
of these groups subsist. From this point of view the various adaptive
modifications of mammalian dentition may be roughly grouped
under the headings of piscivorous, carnivorous, insectivorous,
omnivorous and herbivorous.</p>

<p>The fish-eating, or piscivorous, type of dentition is exemplified
under two phases in the dolphins and in the seals (being in the latter
instance a kind of retrograde modification from the carnivorous type).
In the dolphins, and in a somewhat less marked degree among the
seals, this type of dentition consists of an extensive series of conical,
nearly equal-sized, sharp-pointed teeth, implanted in an elongated
and rather narrow mouth (fig. 1), and adapted to seize slippery prey
without either tearing or masticating. In the dolphins the teeth
form simple cones, but in the seals they are often trident-like; while
in the otters the dentition differs but little from the ordinary
carnivorous type.</p>

<p>This carnivorous adaptation, in which the function is to hold and
kill struggling animals, often of large size, attains its highest development
in the cats (<i>Felidae</i>). The canines are in consequence greatly
developed, of a cutting and piercing type, and from their wide separation
in the mouth give a firm hold; the jaws being as short as is
consistent with the free action of the canines, or tusks, so that no
power is lost. The incisors are small, so as not to interfere with the
penetrating action of the tusks; and the crowns of some of the teeth
of the cheek-series are modified into scissor-like blades, in order to
rasp off the flesh from the bones, or to crack the bones themselves,
while the later teeth of this series tend to disappear.</p>

<p>In the insectivorous type, as exemplified in moles and shrew-mice,
the middle pair of incisors in each jaw are long and pointed so as
to have a forceps-like action for seizing insects, the hard coats of
which are broken up by the numerous sharp cusps surmounting the
cheek-teeth.</p>

<p>In the omnivorous type, as exemplified in man and monkeys,
and to a less specialized degree in swine, the incisors are of moderate
and nearly equal size; the canines, if enlarged, serve for other purposes
than holding prey, and such enlargement is usually confined
to those of the males; while the cheek-teeth have broad flattened
crowns surmounted by rounded bosses, or tubercles.</p>

<p>In the herbivorous modification, as seen in three distinct phases
in the horse, the kangaroo, and in ruminants, the incisors are generally
well developed in one or both jaws, and have a nipping action,
either against one another or against a toothless hard pad in the
upper jaw; while the canines are usually small or absent, at least in
the upper jaw, but in the lower jaw may be approximated and
assimilated to the incisors. The cheek-teeth are large, with broad
flattened crowns surmounted either by simple transverse ridges, or
complicated by elevations and infoldings. In the specialized forms
the premolars tend to become more or less completely like the molars;
and, contrary to what obtains among the Carnivora, the whole series
of cheek-teeth (with the occasional exception of the first) is very
strongly developed.</p>

<p>Opinions differ as to the mode in which the more complicated
cheek-teeth of mammals have been evolved from a simpler type of
tooth. According to one theory, this has been brought about by
the fusion of two or more teeth of a simple conical type to form
a compound tooth. A more generally accepted view&mdash;especially
among palaeontologists&mdash;is the tritubercular theory, according to
which the most generalized type of tooth consists of three cusps
arranged in a triangle, with the apex pointing inwards in the teeth
of the upper jaw. Additions of extra cusps form teeth of a more
complicated type. Each cusp of the primitive triangle has received
a separate name, both in the teeth of the upper and of the lower jaw,
while names have also been assigned to super-added cusps. Molar
teeth of the simple tritubercular type persist in the golden moles
(<i>Chrysochloris</i>) among the Insectivora and also in the marsupial
mole (<i>Notoryctes</i>) among the marsupials. The type is, moreover,
common among the mammals of the early Eocene, and still more so
in those of the Jurassic epoch; this forming one of the strongest
arguments in favour of the tritubercular theory. (See Professor
H. F. Osborn, &ldquo;Palaeontological Evidence for the Original Tritubercular
Theory,&rdquo; in vol. xvii. (new series) of the <i>American Journal
of Science</i>, 1904.)</p>

<p><i>Digestive System.</i>&mdash;As already mentioned, mammals are specially
characterized by the division of the body-cavity into two main
chambers, by means of the horizontal muscular partition known as
the diaphragm, which is perforated by the great blood-vessels and
the alimentary tube. The mouth of the great majority of mammals
is peculiar for being guarded by thick fleshy lips, which are, however,
absent in the Cetacea; their principal function being to seize the
food, for which purpose they are endowed, as a rule, with more or
less strongly marked prehensile power. The roof of the mouth is
formed by the palate, terminating behind by a muscular, contractile
arch, having in man and a few other species a median projection
called the uvula, beneath which the mouth communicates with the
pharynx. The anterior part of the palate is composed of mucous
membrane tightly stretched over the flat or slightly concave bony
layer which separates the mouth from the nasal passages, and is
generally raised into a series of transverse ridges, which sometimes,
as in ruminants, attain a considerable development. In the floor of
the mouth, between the two branches of the lower jaw, and supported
behind by the hyoid apparatus, lies the tongue, an organ the free
surface of which, especially in its posterior part, is devoted to the
sense of taste, but which by reason of its great mobility (being
composed almost entirely of muscular fibres) performs important
mechanical functions connected with masticating and procuring
food. Its modifications of form in different mammals are numerous.
Between the long, extensile, worm-like tongue of the anteaters,
essential to the peculiar mode of feeding of those animals, and the
short, immovable and almost functionless tongue of the porpoise,
every intermediate condition is found. Whatever the form, the
upper surface is, however, covered with numerous fine papillae, in
which the terminal filaments of the taste-nerve are distributed.
In some mammals, notably lemurs, occurs a hard structure known as
the sublingua, which may terminate in a free horny tip. If, as has
been suggested, this organ represents the tongue of reptiles, the
mammalian tongue will obviously be a super-added organ distinctive
of the class.</p>

<p>Salivary glands, of which the most constant are the parotid and
the submaxillary, are always present in terrestrial mammals.
Next in constancy are the &ldquo;sublingual,&rdquo; closely associated with the
last-named, at all events in the locality in
which the secretion is poured out; and the
&ldquo;zygomatic,&rdquo; found only in some mammals
in the cheek, just under cover of the
anterior part of the zygomatic arch, the duct
entering the mouth-cavity near that of
the parotid.</p>

<p>The alimentary, or intestinal, canal varies
greatly in relative length and capacity in
different mammals, and also offers manifold
peculiarities of form, being sometimes a
simple cylindrical tube of nearly uniform
calibre throughout, but more often subject
to alterations of form and capacity in
different portions of its course&mdash;the most
characteristic and constant being the
division into an upper and narrower and a
lower and wider portion, called respectively
the small and the large intestine; the
former being arbitrarily divided into
duodenum, jejunum and ileum, and the
latter into colon and rectum. One of the
most striking peculiarities of this part of
the canal is the frequent presence of a blind
pouch, &ldquo;caecum,&rdquo; situated at the junction
of the large and the small intestine. Their
structure presents an immense variety of
development, from the smallest bulging of
a portion of the side-wall of the tube to a
huge and complex sac, greatly exceeding
in capacity the remainder of the alimentary
canal. It is only in herbivorous mammals
that the caecum is developed to this great
extent, and among these there is a complementary
relationship between the size
and complexity of the organ and that of
the stomach. Where the latter is simple
the caecum is generally the largest, and
vice versa. In vol. xvii. (1905) of the <i>Transactions</i> of the Zoological
Society of London, Dr P. Chalmers Mitchell has identified the
paired caeca, or blind appendages, of the intestine of birds with
the usually single caecum of mammals. These caeca occur in birds
(as in mammals) at the junction of the small with the large intestine;
and while in ordinary perching-birds they are reduced to small nipple-like
buds of no functional importance, in many other birds&mdash;owls for
instance&mdash;they form quite long receptacles. Among mammals,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page525" id="page525"></a>525</span>
the horse and the dog may be cited as instances where the single
caecum is of large size, this being especially the case of the former,
where it is of enormous dimensions; in human beings, on the other
hand, the caecum is rudimentary, and best known in connexion
with &ldquo;appendicitis.&rdquo; The existence of paired caeca was previously
known in a few armadillos and anteaters, but Dr Mitchell has
shown that they are common in these groups, while he has also
recorded their occurrence in the hyrax and the manati. With the
aid of these instances of paired caeca, coupled with the frequent
existence of a rudiment of its missing fellow when only one is
functional, the author has been enabled to demonstrate conclusively
that these double organs in birds correspond in relations with their
normally single representative in mammals.</p>

<p>In mammals both caecum and colon are often sacculated, a disposition
caused by the arrangement of the longitudinal bands of muscular
tissue in their walls; but the small intestine is always smooth and
simple-walled externally, though its lining membrane often exhibits
contrivances for increasing the absorbing surface without adding
to the general bulk of the organ, such as the numerous small tags, or
&ldquo;villi,&rdquo; by which it is everywhere beset, and the more obvious
transverse, longitudinal, or reticulating folds projecting into the
interior, met with in many animals, of which the &ldquo;valvulae conniventes&rdquo;
of man form well-known examples. Besides the crypts
of Lieberkühn found throughout the intestinal canal, and the
glands of Brunner confined to the duodenum, there are other
structures in the mucous membrane, about the nature of which
there is still much uncertainty, called &ldquo;solitary&rdquo; and &ldquo;agminated&rdquo;
glands, the latter more commonly known by the name of &ldquo;Peyer&rsquo;s
patches.&rdquo; Of the liver little need be said, except that in all living
mammals it has been divided into a number of distinct lobes, which
have received separate names. It has, indeed, been suggested that
in the earlier mammals the liver was a simple undivided organ.
This, however, is denied by G. Ruge (vol. xxix. of Gegenbaur&rsquo;s
<i>Morphologisches Jahrbuch</i>).</p>

<p><i>Origin of Mammals.</i>&mdash;That mammals have become differentiated
from a lower type of vertebrates at least as early as the
commencement of the Jurassic period is abundantly testified
by the occurrence of the remains of small species in strata of
that epoch, some of which are mentioned in the articles
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Marsupialia</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Monotremata</a></span> (<i>q.v.</i>). Possibly mammalian
remains also occur in the antecedent Triassic epoch, some
palaeontologists regarding the South African <i>Tritylodon</i> as a
mammal, while others consider that it was probably a reptile.
Whatever may be the true state of the case with regard to that
animal probably also holds good in the case of the approximately
contemporaneous European <i>Microlestes</i>. Of the European
Jurassic (or Oolitic) mammals our knowledge is unfortunately
very imperfect; and from the scarcity of their remains it is quite
probable that they are merely stragglers from the region (possibly
Africa) where the class was first differentiated. It is not till the
early Eocene that mammals become a dominant type in the
northern hemisphere.</p>

<p>It is now practically certain that mammals are descended
from reptiles. Dr H. Gadow, in a paper on the origin of mammals
contributed to the <i>Zeitschrift für Morphologie</i>, sums up as follows:
&ldquo;Mammals are descendants of reptiles as surely as they [the
latter] have been evolved from Amphibia. This does not mean
that any of the living groups of reptiles can claim their honour
of ancestry, but it means that the mammals have branched
where the principal reptilian groups meet, and that is a long
way back. The Theromorpha, especially small Theriodontia,
alone show us what these creatures were like.&rdquo; It may be
explained that the Theromorpha, or Anomodontia, are those
extinct reptiles so common in the early Secondary (Triassic)
deposits of South Africa, some of which present a remarkable
resemblance in their dentition and skeleton to mammals, while
others come equally near amphibians. A difficulty naturally
arises with regard to the fact that in reptiles the occipital condyle
by which the skull articulates with the vertebral column is
single, although composed of three elements, whereas in amphibians
and mammals the articulation is formed by a pair of
condyles. Nevertheless, according to Professor H. F. Osborn,
the tripartite reptilian condyle, by the loss of its median element,
has given rise to the paired mammalian condyles; so that this
difficulty disappears. The fate of the reptilian quadrate bone
(which is reduced to very small dimensions in the Anomodontia)
has been referred to in an earlier section of the present article,
where some mention has also been made of the disappearance in
mammals of the hinder elements of the reptilian lower jaw, so
as to leave the single bone (dentary) of each half of this part
of the skeleton in mammals.</p>

<p>Most of the earliest known mammals appear to be related to
the Marsupialia and Insectivora. Others however (inclusive
of <i>Tritylodon</i> and <i>Microlestes</i>, if they be really mammals), seem
nearer to the Monotremata; and the question has yet to be
decided whether placentals and marsupials on the one hand,
and monotremes on the other are not independently derived
from reptilian ancestors.</p>

<p>With regard to the evolution of marsupials and placentals,
it has been pointed out that the majority of modern marsupials
exhibit in the structure of their feet traces of the former opposability
of the thumb and great toe to the other digits; and it
has accordingly been argued that all marsupials are descended
from arboreal ancestors. This doctrine is now receiving widespread
acceptation among anatomical naturalists; and in the
<i>American Naturalist</i> for 1904, Dr W. D. Matthew, an American
palaeontologist, considers himself provisionally justified in so
extending it as to include all mammals. That is to say, he
believes that, with the exception of the duckbill and the echidna,
the mammalian class as a whole can lay claim to descent from
small arboreal forms. This view is, of course, almost entirely
based upon palaeontological considerations; and these, in the
author&rsquo;s opinion, admit of the conclusion that all modern
placental and marsupial mammals are descended from a common
ancestral stock, of which the members were small in bodily size.
These ancestral mammals, in addition to their small size, were
characterized by the presence of five toes to each foot, of which
the first was more or less completely opposable to the other four.
The evidence in favour of this primitive opposability is considerable.
In all the groups which are at present arboreal, the
palaeontological evidence goes to show that their ancestors
were likewise so; while since, in the case of modern terrestrial
forms, the structure of the wrist and ankle joints tends to
approximate to the arboreal type, as we recede in time, the
available evidence, so far as it goes, is in favour of Dr Matthew&rsquo;s
contention.</p>

<p>The same author also discusses the proposition from another
standpoint, namely, the condition of the earth&rsquo;s surface in
Cretaceous times. His theory is that in the early Cretaceous
epoch the animals of the world were mostly aerial, amphibious,
aquatic or arboreal; the flora of the land being undeveloped
as compared with its present state. On the other hand, towards
the close of the Cretaceous epoch (when the Chalk was in course
of deposition), the spread of a great upland flora vastly extended
the territory available for mammalian life. Accordingly, it was
at this epoch that the small ancestral insectivorous mammals
first forsook their arboreal habitat to try a life on the open
plains, where their descendants developed on the one hand into
the carnivorous and other groups, in which the toes are armed
with nails or claws, and on the other into the hoofed group,
inclusive of such monsters as the elephant and the giraffe. The
hypothesis is not free from certain difficulties, one of which
will be noticed later.</p>

<p><i>Classification</i>.&mdash;Existing mammals may be primarily divided
into three main groups, or subclasses, of which the second and
third are much more closely related to one another than is either
of them to the first. These three classes are the Monotremata
(or Prototheria), the Marsupialia (Didelphia, or Metatheria),
and the Placentalia (Monodelphia, or Eutheria); the distinctive
characters of each being given in separate articles (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Monotremata</a></span>,
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Marsupialia</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Monodelphia</a></span>.)</p>

<p>Separate articles are devoted to each of these orders, where references
will be found to other articles dealing with some of the minor
groups and a number of the more representative species.</p>

<p><i>Relationships of the Groups.</i>&mdash;As we recede in time we find the
extinct representatives of many of these orders approximating more
and more closely to a common generalized type, so that in a large
number of early Eocene forms it is often difficult to decide to which
group they should be assigned.</p>

<p>The Insectivora are certainly the lowest group of existing placental
mammals, and exhibit many signs of affinity with marsupials; they
may even be a more generalized group than the latter. From the
Insectivora the bats, or Chiroptera, are evidently a specialized lateral
offshoot; while the Dermoptera may be another branch from the
same stock. As to the Edentata, it is still a matter of uncertainty
whether the pangolins (Pholidota) and the ant-bears (Tubulidentata)
are rightly referred to an order typically represented by the sloths,
anteaters, and armadillos of South and Central America, or whether
the two first-named groups have any close relationship with one
another. Much uncertainty prevails with regard to the ancestry
of the group as a whole, although some of the earlier South American
forms have a comparatively full series of teeth, which are also of a
less degenerate type than those of their modern representatives.</p>

<p>An almost equal degree of doubt obtains with regard to the
ancestry of that very compact and well-defined group the Rodentia.
If, however, the so-called Proglires of the lower Eocene are really
ancestral rodents, the order is brought into comparatively close
connexion with the early generalized types of clawed, or unguiculate
mammals. Whether the extinct Tillodontia are most nearly allied
to the Rodentia, the Carnivore or the Ungulata, and whether they
are really entitled to constitute an ordinal group by themselves,
must remain for the present open questions.</p>

<p>The Carnivora, as represented by the (mainly) Eocene Creodonta,
are evidently an ancient and generalized type. As regards the number
and form of their permanent teeth, at any rate, creodonts present
such a marked similarity to carnivorous marsupials, that it is difficult
to believe the two groups are not allied, although the nature of the
relationship is not yet understood, and the minute internal structure
of the teeth is unlike that of marsupials and similar to that of modern
Carnivora. There is the further possibility that creodonts may be
directly descended from the carnivorous reptiles; a descent which if
proved might introduce some difficulty with regard to the above-mentioned
theory as to the arboreal ancestry of mammals generally.
Be this as it may, there can be little doubt that the creodonts are
related to the Insectivora, which, as stated above, show decided signs
of kinship with the marsupials.</p>

<p>A much more interesting relationship of the creodont carnivora
has, however, been established on the evidence of recent discoveries
in Egypt. From remains of Eocene age in that country Dr E. Fraas,
of Stuttgart, has demonstrated the derivation of the whale-like
<i>Zeuglodon</i> from the creodonts. Dr C. E. Andrews has, moreover,
not only brought forward additional evidence in favour of this most
remarkable line of descent, but is confident&mdash;which Professor Fraas
was not&mdash;that <i>Zeuglodon</i> itself is an ancestral cetacean, and
consequently that whales are the highly modified descendants of
creodonts. It must be admitted, however, that the links between
<i>Zeuglodon</i> and typical cetaceans are at present unknown; but it may
be hoped that these will be eventually brought to light from the
deposits of the Mokattam Range, near Cairo. Whales and dolphins
being thus demonstrated to be nothing more than highly modified
Carnivora, might almost be included in the same ordinal group.</p>

<p>An analogous statement may be made with regard to the sea-cows,
or Sirenia, which appear to be derivates from the great herbivorous
order of Ungulata, and might consequently be included in that
group, as indeed has been already done in Dr Max Weber&rsquo;s classification.
It is with the proboscidean suborder of the Ungulata to which
the Sirenia are most nearly related; the nature of this relationship
being described by Dr Andrews as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the first place, the occurrence of the most primitive Sirenians
with which we are acquainted in the same region as the most generalized
proboscidean, <i>Moeritherium</i>, is in favour of such a view, and this
is further supported by the similarity of the brain-structure and,
to some extent, of the pelvis in the earliest-known members of the
two groups. Moreover, in the anatomy of the soft-parts of the recent
forms there are a number of remarkable points of resemblance.
Among the common characters may be noted the possession of:
(1) pectoral mammae; (2) abdominal testes; (3) a bifid apex of the
heart; (4) bilophodont molars with a tendency to the formation of
an additional lobe from the posterior part of the cingulum. The
peculiar mode of displacement of the teeth from behind forwards
in some members of both groups may perhaps indicate a relationship,
although in the case of the Sirenia the replacement takes place by
means of a succession of similar molars, while in the Proboscidea the
molars remain the same numerically, but increase greatly in size
and number of transverse ridges.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These and certain other facts referred to by the same author point
to the conclusion that not only are the Sirenia and the Proboscidea
derived from a single ancestral stock, but that the Hyracoidea&mdash;and
so <i>Arsinöitherium</i>&mdash;are also derivatives from the same stock, which
must necessarily have been Ethiopian.</p>

<p>Of the other suborders of ungulates, the Toxodontia and Litopterna
are exclusively South American, and while the former may
possibly be related to the Hyracoidea and Barypoda, the latter is
perhaps more nearly akin to the Perissodactyla. The Amblypoda,
on the other hand, are perhaps not far removed from the ancestral
Proboscidea, which depart comparatively little from the generalized
ungulate type. The latter is represented by the Eocene Condylarthra,
which undoubtedly gave rise to the Perissodactyla and Artiodactyla,
and probably to most, if not all, of the other groups. The
Condylarthra, in their turn, approximate closely to the ancestral
Carnivora, as they also do in some degree to the ancestral Primates.
As regards the latter order, although we are at present unacquainted
with all the connecting links between the lemurs and the monkeys,
there is little doubt that the ancestors of the former represent the
stock from which the latter have originated. C. D. Earle, in the
<i>American Naturalist</i> for 1897, observes that &ldquo;so far as the palaeontological
evidence goes it is decidedly in favour of the view that apes
and lemurs are closely related. Beginning with the earliest known
lemur, <i>Anaptomorphus</i>, this genus shows tendencies towards the
anthropoids, and, when we pass up into the Oligocene of the Old
World, <i>Adapis</i> is a decidedly mixed type, and probably not far from
the common stem-form which gave origin to both suborders of the
Primates. In regard to <i>Tarsius</i>, it is evidently a type nearly between
the lemurs and apes, but with many essential characters belonging
to the former group.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p><i>Distribution.</i>&mdash;For an account of the &ldquo;realms&rdquo; and &ldquo;regions&rdquo;
into which the surface of the globe has been divided by those
who have made a special study of the geographical distribution
of animals, see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Zoological Distribution</a></span>. For the purposes
of such zoo-geographical divisions, mammals are much better
adapted than birds, owing to their much more limited powers
of dispersal; most of them (exclusive of the purely aquatic
forms, such as seals, whales, dolphins and sea-cows) being unable
to cross anything more than a very narrow arm of the sea.
Consequently, the presence of nearly allied groups of mammals
in areas now separated by considerable stretches of sea proves
that at no very distant date such tracts must have had a land-connexion.
In the case of the southern continents the difficulty
is, however, to determine whether allied groups of mammals
(and other animals) have reached their present isolated habitats
by dispersal from the north along widely sundered longitudinal
lines, or whether such a distribution implies the former existence
of equatorial land-connexions. It may be added that even bats
are unable to cross large tracts of sea; and the fact that fruit-bats
of the genus <i>Pteropus</i> are found in Madagascar and the
Seychelles, as well as in India, while they are absent from Africa,
is held to be an important link in the chain of evidence demonstrating
a former land-connexion between Madagascar and
India.</p>

<p>There is another point of view from which mammals are of
especial importance in regard to geographical distribution,
namely their comparatively late rise and dispersal, or &ldquo;radiation,&rdquo;
as compared with reptiles.</p>

<p>As regards terrestrial mammals (with which alone we are at
present concerned), one of the most striking features in their
distribution is their practical absence from oceanic islands; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page527" id="page527"></a>527</span>
only species found in such localities being either small forms
which might have been carried on floating timber, or such as
have been introduced by human agency. This absence of mammalian
life in oceanic islands extends even to New Zealand,
where the indigenous mammals comprise only two peculiar
species of bats, the so-called Maori rat having been introduced
by man.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>One of the leading features in mammalian distribution is the fact
that the Monotremata, or egg-laying mammals, are exclusively
confined to Australia and Papua, with the adjacent islands. The
marsupials also attain their maximum development in Australia
(&ldquo;Notogaea&rdquo; of the distributionists), extending, however, as far west
as Celebes and the Moluccas, although in these islands they form
an insignificant minority among an extensive placental fauna,
being represented only by the cuscuses (<i>Phalanger</i>), a group unknown
in either Papua or Australia. Very different, on the other hand,
is the condition of things in Australia and Papua, where marsupials
(and monotremes) are the dominant forms of mammalian life,
the placentals being represented (apart from bats, which are mainly
of an Asiatic type) only by a number of more or less aberrant rodents
belonging to the mouse-tribe, and in Australia by the dingo, or native
dog, and in New Guinea by a wild pig. The dingo was, however,
almost certainly brought from Asia by the ancestors of the modern
natives; while the Papuan pig is also in all probability a human
introduction, very likely of much later date. The origin of the
Australasian fauna is a question pertaining to the article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Zoological
Distribution</a></span>. The remaining marsupials (namely the families
<i>Didelphyidae</i> and <i>Epanorthidae</i>) are American, and mainly South
and Central American at the present day; although during the early
part of the Tertiary period representatives of the first-named family
ranged all over the northern hemisphere.</p>

<p>The Insectivora (except a few shrews which have entered from the
north) are absent from South America, and appear to have been
mainly an Old World group, the only forms which have entered
North America being the shrew-mice (<i>Soricidae</i>) and moles (<i>Talpidae</i>).
The occurrence of one aberrant group (<i>Solenodon</i>) in the West
Indies is, however, noteworthy. The family with the widest distribution
is the <i>Soricidae</i>, the <i>Talpidae</i> being unknown in Africa.
The tree-shrews (<i>Tupaiidae</i>) are exclusively Asiatic, whereas the
jumping-shrews (<i>Macroscelididae</i>) are equally characteristic of the
African continent. Madagascar is the sole habitat of the tenrecs
(<i>Centetidae</i>), as is Southern Africa of the golden moles (<i>Chrysochloridae</i>).
It is, however, important to mention that an extinct
South American insectivore, <i>Necrolestes</i>, has been referred to the
family last mentioned; and even if this reference should not
be confirmed in the future, the occurrence of a representative of
the order in Patagonia is a fact of considerable importance in
distribution.</p>

<p>The Rodentia have a wider geographical range than any other
order of terrestrial mammals, being, as already mentioned, represented
by numerous members of the mouse-tribe (<i>Muridae</i>) even
in Australasia. With the remarkable exception of Madagascar,
where it is represented by the <i>Nesomyidae</i>, that family has thus a
cosmopolitan distribution. Very noteworthy is the fact that, with
the exception of Madagascar (and of course Australia) the squirrel
family (<i>Sciuridae</i>) is also found in all parts of the world. Precisely
the same may be said of the hares, which, however, become scarce
in South America. On the other hand, the scaly-tailed squirrels
(<i>Anomaluridae</i>), the jumping-hares (<i>Pedetidae</i>), and the strand-moles
(<i>Bathyergidae</i>) are exclusively African; while the sewellels
(<i>Haplodontidae</i>) and the pocket-gophers (<i>Geomyidae</i>) are as characteristically
North American, although a few members of the latter
have reached Central America. The beavers (<i>Castoridae</i>) are restricted
to the northern hemisphere, whereas the dormice (<i>Gliridae</i>)
and the mole-rats (<i>Spalacidae</i>) are exclusively Old World forms, the
latter only entering the north of Africa, in which continent the former
are largely developed. The jerboa group (<i>Dipodidae</i>, or <i>Jaculidae</i>) is
also mainly an Old World type, although its aberrant representatives
the jumping-mice (<i>Zapus</i>) have effected an entrance into Arctic
North America. Porcupines enjoy a very wide range, being represented
throughout the warmer parts of the Old World, with the exception
of Madagascar (and of course Australasia), by the <i>Hystricidae</i>,
and in the New World by the <i>Erethizontidae</i>. Of the remaining
families of the Simplicidentata, all are southern, the cavies (<i>Caviidae</i>),
chinchillas (<i>Chinchillidae</i>), and degus (<i>Octodontidae</i>) being Central
and South American, while the <i>Capromyidae</i> are common to southern
America and Africa, and the <i>Ctenodactylidae</i> are exclusively African.
The near alliance of all these southern families, and the absence of
so many Old World families from Madagascar form two of the most
striking features in the distribution of the order. Lastly, among
the Duplicidentata, the picas (<i>Ochotonidae</i> or <i>Lagomyidae</i>) form a
group confined to the colder or mountainous regions of the northern
hemisphere.</p>

<p>Among the existing land Carnivora (of which no representatives
except the introduced dingo are found in Australasia) the cat-tribe
(<i>Felidae</i>) has now an almost cosmopolitan range, although it only
reached South America at a comparatively recent date. Its original
home was probably in the northern hemisphere; and it has no
representatives in Madagascar. The civet-tribe (<i>Viverridae</i>), on the
other hand, which is exclusively an Old World group, is abundant in
Madagascar, where it is represented by peculiar and aberrant types.
The hyenas (<i>Hyaenidae</i>), at any rate at the present day, to which
consideration is mainly limited, are likewise Old World. The dog-tribe
(<i>Canidae</i>), on the other hand, are, with the exception of Madagascar,
an almost cosmopolitan group. Their place of origin was,
however, almost entirely in the northern hemisphere, and not improbably
in some part of the Old World, where they gave rise to the
bears (<i>Ursidae</i>). The latter are abundant throughout the northern
hemisphere, and have even succeeded in penetrating into South
America, but, with the exception of the Mediterranean zone, have
never succeeded in entering Africa, and are therefore of course
unknown in Madagascar. The raccoon group (<i>Procyonidae</i>) is
mainly American, being represented in the Old World only by the
pandas (<i>Aelurus</i> and <i>Aeluropus</i>), of which the latter apparently
exhibits some affinity to the bears. The birthplace of the group
was evidently in the northern hemisphere&mdash;possibly in east Central
Asia. The weasel-tribe (<i>Mustelidae</i>) is clearly a northern group,
which has, however, succeeded in penetrating into South America
and Africa, although it has never reached Madagascar.</p>

<p>The extinct creodonts, especially if they be the direct descendants
of the anomodont reptiles, may have originated in Africa, although
they are at present known in that continent only from the Fayum
district. Elsewhere they occur in South America and throughout
a large part of the northern hemisphere, where they appear to have
survived in India to the later Oligocene or Miocene.</p>

<p>In the case of the great order, or assemblage, of Ungulata it is
necessary to pay somewhat more attention to fossil forms, since a
considerable number of groups are either altogether extinct or largely
on the wane.</p>

<p>So far as is at present known, the earliest and most primitive
group, the Condylarthra, is a northern one, but whether first developed
in the eastern or the western hemisphere there is no sufficient
evidence. The more or less specialized Litopterna and Toxodontia,
as severally typified by the macrauchenia and the toxodon, are, on
the other hand, exclusively South American. With the primitive
five-toed Amblypoda, as represented by the coryphodon, we again
reach a northern group, common to the two hemispheres; but there
is not improbably some connexion between this group and the much
more specialized Barypoda, as represented by <i>Arsinöitherium</i>, of
Africa. The Ancylopoda, again, typified by <i>Chalicotherium</i>, and
characterized by the claw-like character of the digits, are probably
another northern group, common to the eastern and western hemispheres.</p>

<p>Recent discoveries have demonstrated the African origin of the
elephants (Proboscidea) and hyraxes (Hyracoidea), the latter group
being still indeed mainly African, and in past times also limited to
Africa and the Mediterranean countries. As regards the elephants
(now restricted to Africa and tropical Asia), there appears to be
evidence that the ancestral mastodons, after having developed from
African forms probably not very far removed from the Amblypoda,
migrated into Asia, where they gave rise to the true elephants.
Thence both elephants and mastodons reached North America by
the Bering Sea route; while the former, which arrived earlier than the
latter, eventually penetrated into South America.</p>

<p>The now waning group of Perissodactyla would appear to have
originally been a northern one, as all the three existing families,
rhinoceroses (<i>Rhinocerotidae</i>), tapirs (<i>Tapiridae</i>), and horses
(<i>Equidae</i>), are well represented in the Tertiaries of both halves of
the northern hemisphere. If eastern Central Asia were tentatively
given as the centre of radiation of the group, this might perhaps best
accord with the nature of the case. Rhinoceroses disappeared
comparatively early from the New World, and never reached
South America. In Siberia and northern Europe species of an
African type survived till a comparatively late epoch, so that the
present relegation of the group to tropical Asia and Africa may be
regarded as a modern feature in distribution. Horses, now unknown
in a wild state in the New World, although still widely spread in
the Old, attained a more extensive range in past times, having successfully
invaded South America. On the other hand, in common
with the rest of the Perissodactyla, they never reached Madagascar.
In addition to the occurrence of their fossil remains almost throughout
the world, the former wide range of the tapirs is attested by the
fact of their living representatives being confined to such widely
sundered areas as Malaysia and tropical America.</p>

<p>The Artiodactyla are the only group of ungulates known to have
been represented in Madagascar; but since both these Malagasy
forms&mdash;namely two hippopotamuses (now extinct) and a river-hog&mdash;are
capable of swimming, it is most probable that they reached
the island by crossing the Mozambique Channel. As regards the
deer-family (<i>Cervidae</i>), which is unknown in Africa south of the
Sahara, it is quite evident that it originated in the northern half
of the Old World, whence it reached North America by the Bering
Sea route, and eventually travelled into South America. More
light is required with regard to the past history of the giraffe-family
(<i>Giraffidae</i>), which includes the African okapi and the extinct
Indian <i>Sivatherium</i>, and is unknown in the New World. Possibly,
however, its birthplace may prove to be Africa; if so, we shall have
a case analogous to that of the African elephant, namely that while
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page528" id="page528"></a>528</span>
giraffes flourished during the Pliocene in Asia (where they may have
originated), they survive only in Africa. An African origin has also
been suggested for the hollow-horned ruminants (<i>Bovidae</i>); and if
this were substantiated it would explain the abundance of that family
in Africa and the absence from the heart of that continent of the
deer-tribe. Some confirmation of this theory is afforded by the fact
that whereas we can recognize ancestral deer in the Tertiaries of
Europe we cannot point with certainty to the forerunners of
the <i>Bovidae</i>. Whether its birthplace was in Africa or to the north,
it is, however, clear that the hollow-horned ruminants are essentially
an Old World group, which only effected an entrance into North
America at a comparatively recent date, and never succeeded in
reaching South America. So far as it goes, this fact is also in favour
of the African ancestry of the group.</p>

<p>The <i>Antilocapridae</i> (prongbuck), whose relationships appear to
be rather with the <i>Cervidae</i> than with the <i>Bovidae</i>, are on the other
hand apparently a North American group. The chevrotains
(<i>Tragulidae</i>), now surviving only in West and Central Africa and
tropical Asia, are conversely a purely Old World group.</p>

<p>The camels (<i>Tylopoda</i>) certainly originated in the northern
hemisphere, but although their birthplace has been confidently
claimed for North America, an equal, if not stronger, claim may be
made on the part of Central Asia. From the latter area, where wild
camels still exist, the group may be assumed to have made its way
at an early period into North America; whence, at a much later
date, it finally penetrated into South America. In the Old World
it seems to have reached the fringe of the African continent, where
its wanderings in a wild state were stayed.</p>

<p>The pigs (<i>Suidae</i>) and the hippopotamuses (<i>Hippopotamidae</i>)
are essentially Old World groups, the former of which has alone
succeeded in reaching America, where it is represented by the collateral
branch of the peccaries (<i>Dicotylinae</i>). An African origin
would well explain the present distribution of both groups, but further
evidence on this point is required before anything decisive can
be affirmed, although it is noteworthy that the earliest known pig
(<i>Geniohyus</i>) is African. The Suinae are at present spread all over
the Old World, although the African forms (other than the one from
the north) are markedly distinct from those inhabiting Europe and
Asia. Hippopotamuses, on the contrary, are now exclusively African,
although they were represented in tropical Asia during the Pliocene
and over the greater part of Europe at a later epoch.</p>

<p>A brief notice with regard to the distribution of the Primates
must suffice, as their past history is too imperfectly known to admit
of generalizations being drawn. The main facts at the present day
are, firstly, the restriction of the Prosimiae, or lemurs, to the warmer
parts of the Old World, and their special abundance in Madagascar
(where other Primates are wanting); and, secondly, the wide
structural distinction between the monkeys of tropical America
(Platyrrhina), and the Old World monkeys and apes, or Catarrhina.
It is, however, noteworthy that extinct lemurs occur in the Tertiary
deposits of both halves of the northern hemisphere&mdash;a fact which
has induced Dr J. L. Wortman to suggest a polar origin for the entire
group&mdash;a view we are not yet prepared to endorse. For the distribution
of the various families and genera the reader may be referred
to the article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Primates</a></span>; and it will suffice to mention here that while
chimpanzees and baboons are now restricted to Africa and (in the
case of the latter group) Arabia, they formerly occurred in India.</p>

<p>As regards aquatic mammals, the greater number of the Cetacea,
or whales and dolphins, have, as might be expected, a very wide
distribution in the ocean. A few, on the other hand, have a very
restricted range, the Greenland right whale (<i>Balaena mysticetus</i>)
being, for instance, limited to the zone of the northern circumpolar
ice, while no corresponding species occurs in the southern hemisphere.
In this case, not only temperature, but also the peculiar mode of
feeding, may be the cause. The narwhal and the beluga have a
very similar distribution, though the latter occasionally ranges
farther south. The bottle-noses (<i>Hyperöodon</i>) are restricted to the
North Atlantic, never entering, so far as known, the tropical seas.
Other species are exclusively tropical or austral in their range. The
pigmy whale (<i>Neobalaena marginata</i>), for instance, has only been
met with in the seas round Australia, New Zealand and South
America, while a beaked whale (<i>Berardius arnouxi</i>) appears to be
confined to the New Zealand seas.</p>

<p>The Cetacea, however, are by no means limited to the ocean, or
even to salt water, some entering large rivers for considerable distances,
and others being exclusively fluviatile. The susu (<i>Platanista</i>)
is, for instance, extensively distributed throughout nearly the whole
of the river systems of the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Indus, ascending
as high as there is water enough to swim in, but apparently
never passing out to sea. The individuals inhabiting the Indus and
the Ganges must therefore have been for long ages isolated without
developing any distinctive anatomical characters, those by which
<i>P. indi</i> was separated from <i>P. gangetica</i> having been shown to be
of no constant value. <i>Orcella fluminalis</i>, again, appears to be
limited to the Irrawaddy; and at least two distinct species of dolphin,
belonging to different genera, are found in the Amazon. It is
remarkable that none of the great lakes or inland seas of the world
is inhabited by cetaceans.</p>

<p>The great difference in the manner of life of the sea-cows, or
Sirenia, as compared with that of the Cetacea, causes a corresponding
difference in their geographical distribution. Slow in their movements,
and feeding on vegetable substances, they are confined to the
neighbourhood of rivers, estuaries or coasts, although there is a
possibility of accidental transport by currents across considerable
distances. Of the three genera existing within historic times, one
(<i>Manatus</i>) is exclusively confined to the shores of the tropical Atlantic
and the rivers entering into it, individuals scarcely specifically
distinguishable being found both on the American and the African.
The dugong (<i>Halicore</i>) is distributed in different colonies, at present
isolated, throughout the Indian Ocean from Arabia to North Australia;
while the <i>Rhytina</i> or northern sea-cow was, for some time
before its extinction, limited to a single island in the extreme north
of the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p>The seals (<i>Pinnipedia</i>) although capable of traversing long reaches
of ocean, are less truly aquatic than the last two groups, always
resorting to the land or to ice-floes for breeding. The geographical
range of each species is generally more or less restricted, usually
according to climate, as they are mostly inhabitants either of the
Arctic or Antarctic seas and adjacent temperate regions, few being
found within the tropics. For this reason the northern and the
southern species are for the most part quite distinct. In fact, the
only known exception is the case of a colony of elephant-seals
(<i>Macrorhinus leoninus</i>), whose general range is in the southern
hemisphere, inhabiting the coast of California. In this case a
different specific name has been given to the northern form, but the
characters by which it is distinguished are of little importance, and
probably, except for the abnormal geographical distribution, would
never have been discovered. The most remarkable circumstance
connected with the distribution of seals is the presence of members
of the order in the three isolated great lakes or inland seas of
Central Asia&mdash;the Caspian, Aral and Baikal&mdash;which, notwithstanding
their long isolation, have varied but slightly from species now
inhabiting the Polar Ocean.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MAMMARY GLAND<a name="ar19" id="ar19"></a></span> (Lat. <i>mamma</i>), or female breast, the
organ by means of which the young are suckled, and the possession
of which, in some region of the trunk, entitles the animal
bearing it to a place in the order of Mammalia.</p>

<p><i>Anatomy.</i>&mdash;In the human female the gland extends vertically
from the second to the sixth rib, and transversely from the edge
of the sternum to the mid axillary line; it is embedded in the fat
superficial to the pectoralis major muscle, and a process which
extends toward the arm-pit is sometimes called the axillary tail.
A little below the centre of the glandular swelling is the <i>nipple</i>,
surrounding which is a pigmented circular patch called the areola;
this is studded with slight nodules, which are the openings of
areolar glands secreting an oily fluid to protect the skin during
suckling. During the second or third month of pregnancy the
areola becomes more or less deeply pigmented, but this to a
large extent passes off after lactation ceases. In structure
the gland consists of some fifteen to twenty lobules, each of
which has a <i>lactiferous duct</i> opening at the summit of the nipple,
and branching in the substance of the gland to form secondary
lobules, the walls of which are lined by cubical epithelium in
which the milk is secreted. These secondary lobules project
into the surrounding fat, so that it is difficult to dissect out the
gland cleanly. Before opening at the nipple each lactiferous
duct has a fusiform dilatation called the <i>ampulla</i>.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>After the child-bearing period of life the breasts atrophy and tend
to become pendulous, while in some African races they are pendulous
throughout life. Variations in the mammary glands are common;
often the left breast is larger than the right, and in those rare cases in
which one breast is suppressed it is usually the right, though suppression
of the breast does not necessarily include absence of the nipple.</p>

<p><i>Supernumerary nipples and glands</i> are not uncommon, and, when
they occur, are usually situated in the mammary line which extends
from the anterior axillary fold to the spine of the pubis; hence, when
an extra nipple appears above the normal one, it is external to it,
but, when below, it is nearer the middle line. The condition of
extra breasts is known as <i>polymasty</i>, that of extra nipples as <i>polythely</i>,
and it is interesting to notice that the latter is commoner
in males than in females. O. Ammon (quoted by Wiedersheim)
records the case of a German soldier who had four nipples on each
side. These nipples in the human subject are seldom found below
the costal margin. In normal males the breast structure is present,
but rudimentary, though it is not very rare to find instances of boys
about puberty in whom a small amount of milk is secreted, and one
case at least is recorded of a man who suckled a child. A functional
condition of the mammary glands in men is known as <i>gynaekomasty</i>.
(For further details see <i>The Structure of Man</i>, by R. Wiedersheim,
translated by H. and M. Bernard, and edited by G. B. Howes,
London, 1895.)</p>

<p><i>Embryology.</i>&mdash;There is every probability that the mammary glands
are modified and hypertrophied sebaceous glands, and transitional
stages are seen in the areolar glands, which sometimes secrete milk.
At an early stage of foetal life a raised patch of ectoderm is seen,
which later on becomes a saucer-like depression; from the bottom of
this fifteen or twenty solid processes of cells, each presumably
representing a sebaceous gland, grow into the mesoderm which forms
the connective-tissue stroma of the mamma. Later on these processes
branch. The last stage is that the centre of the <i>mammary
pit</i> or saucer-like depression once more grows up to form the nipple,
and at birth the processes become tubular, thus forming lactiferous
ducts. The glands grow little until the age of puberty, but their
full development is not reached until the birth of the first child.</p>

<p><i>Comparative Anatomy.</i>&mdash;In the lower Mammals the mammary
line, already mentioned, appears in the embryo as a ridge, and in
those which have many young at a birth patches of this develop
in the thoracic and abdominal regions to form the mammae, while
the intervening parts of the ridge disappear. The number of mammae
is not constant in animals of the same species; as an instance of this
it will be found that in the dog the number of nipples varies from
seven to ten, though animals with many nipples are more liable to
variation than those with few. When only a few young are produced
at a time the mammae are few, and it seems to depend on the
convenience of suckling in which part of the mammary line the
glands are developed. In the pouched Mammals (Monotremes and
Marsupials) inguinal mammae are found, and so they are in most
Ungulates as well as in the Cetacea. In the elephants, Sirenia,
Chiroptera and most of the Primates, on the other hand, they are
confined to the pectoral region, and this is also the case in some
Rodents, <i>e.g.</i> the jumping hare (<i>Pedetes caffer</i>). In the monotremes
the mammary pit remains throughout life, and the milk is
conducted along the hairs to the young, but in other Mammals
nipples are formed in one of two ways. One is that already described
in Man, which is common to the Marsupials and Primates, while
in the other the margin or <i>vallum</i> of the mammary pit grows up, and
so forms a nipple with a very deep pit, into the bottom of which
the lactiferous ducts open. The latter is regarded as the primary
arrangement. In the monotremes the mammae are looked upon,
not as modified sebaceous glands, as in other Mammals, but as altered
sweat glands. It is further of interest to notice that in these primitive
Mammals the glands are equally developed in both sexes, and it
is thought that among the bats the male often assists in suckling the
young (see G. Dobson, <i>Brit. Museum Cat. of the Chiroptera</i>, London,
1878). These facts, together with the occasional occurrence of
gynaekomasty in man, make it probable that the ancestral Mammal
was an animal in which both sexes helped in the process of lactation.</p>

<div class="author">(F. G. P.)</div>

<p><i>Diseases of the Mammary Gland.</i>&mdash;Inflammation of the breast
(<i>mastitis</i>) is apt to occur in a woman who is suckling, and is due to
the presence of septic micro-organisms, which, as a rule, have found
their way into the milk-ducts, the lymphatics or the veins, through
a crack, or other wound, in a nipple which has been made sore by
the infant&rsquo;s vigorous attempts to obtain food. Especially is this
septic inflammation apt to occur if the nipple is depressed, or so
badly formed that the infant has difficulty in feeding from it. The
inflamed breast is enlarged, tender and painful, and the skin over it
is hot, and perhaps too reddened. The woman feels ill and feverish,
and she may shiver, or have a definite rigor&mdash;which suggests that
the inflammation is running on to the formation of an abscess. The
abscess may be superficial to, or beneath, the breast, but it is usually
within the breast itself. The infant should at once be weaned, the
milk-tension being relieved by the breast-pump. Fomentations
should be applied under waterproof jaconette, and the breast should
be evenly supported by a bandage or by the corsets. Belladonna
and glycerine should be smeared over the breast, with the view of
checking the secretion of milk, as well as of easing pain. But before
this is done six or eight leeches may be applied. On the first
indication that matter is collecting, an incision should be made, for
if the matter is allowed to remain locked up in the breast tissue
the abscess will rapidly increase in size, and the whole of the breast
may become infected and destroyed. Supposing that, in making
the incision, no pus is discovered, the relief to the vascular tension
thus afforded will be nevertheless highly beneficial. The operation
had better be done under a general anaesthetic, so that the surgeon
can introduce a probe, or his finger, into the wound, breaking down
the partitions which are likely to exist between separate abscesses,
and thus enable them to be drained through the one opening. As
the discharge begins to cease, the tenderness subsides, and gentle
massage, or firm strapping of the breast, will prove useful. The
general treatment will consist in the administration of an aperient,
and, the tongue being clean, in prescribing such drugs as quinine,
strychnia and iron. The diet should be liberal, but not carried to
such excess that the power of digestion and absorption is overtaxed.
During the early acute stage of the disease small doses of morphia
may be necessary. When the tongue has cleaned, a little wine may
be given with advantage.</p>

<p><i>Chronic Eczema</i> around the nipple of a woman late in life, with,
perhaps, localized ulceration, is known as <i>Paget&rsquo;s Disease</i>. The importance
of it is that cancerous infiltration is apt to pass from it
along the milk-ducts and to involve the breast in malignant disease.
Hence, when eczema about the nipple refuses to clear up under
the influence of soothing treatment, it is well to insist on the
removal of the entire breast. Sometimes this eczema is malignant
from the beginning, being associated with the active prolifization of
the epithelial cells of the milk-ducts, and with their escape into the
surrounding tissues. The nipple is retracted in most of these cases,
which, however, are not often met with.</p>

<p><i>Chronic Mastitis</i> is of frequent occurrence in women who are past
middle age. The part of the breast involved is enlarged, hard, and
more or less tender and painful. It is sometimes impossible clinically
to distinguish this disease from cancer. True, the tumour is not so
definite or so hard as a cancer, nor is it attached to the skin, nor
to the muscles of the chest wall, and if there are any glands secondarily
enlarged in the arm-pit they are not so hard as they may be in
cancer. But all these are questions of degree. It is, of course,
highly inadvisable to leave it to time to clear up the diagnosis,
for a chronic mastitis, innocent at first, may eventually become
cancerous. If in any case the difficulty of distinguishing a chronic
mastitis from a malignant tumour of the breast is insuperable, the
safest course is to remove the breast and have it examined by the
microscope. The suggestion, sometimes made, as to the preliminary
removal of a small piece of the tumour for examination is not to be
recommended.</p>

<p>A simple glandular tumour, <i>fibro-adenoma</i>, is apt to be found in
the breasts of youngish women, who may possibly give an account
of some blow or other injury; there may, however, be no history of
injury. The tumour is smooth, rounded or oval, and lies loose in
the midst of the breast; as a rule it is not tender. It is not associated
with enlarged glands in the arm-pit. The tumour had best
be removed, though there is no urgency about the operation, as the
growth is absolutely innocent. There is, however, no telling as to
what course an innocent tumour of the breast may take as middle
age comes on.</p>

<p><i>Cysts of the Breast.</i>&mdash;A <i>galactocele</i> is a tumour due to the locking
up of milk in a greatly dilated duct. Other forms of cystic disease
may be due to serous or hydatid fluid, or to thin pus, being
surrounded by fibrous walls. Such cysts are best treated by
free incision, and by passing a gauze dressing into their depths.
If the tissue is occupied by many cysts, the whole breast had
better be removed.</p>

<p><i>Cancer of the Breast</i> may be met with in men as well as in women;
in men, however, it is very rare. It is commonest in women between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page530" id="page530"></a>530</span>
the ages of forty and fifty. It is sometimes met with in women of
twenty; and the younger the individual the more malignant is the
disease. Married life seems to have no effect as regards the incidence
of the disease, but it often happens that a breast which gave trouble
during the period of suckling becomes later the subject of cancer;
in other cases there is a clear history of the attack having followed an
injury. It is, thus, as if inflammatory changes in the breast were
the direct cause of a later cancerous invasion. Though it is impossible
to affirm that heredity has a great influence in the incidence of cancer,
it is, nevertheless, remarkable that the members of certain families
are unusually prone to the disease.</p>

<p>The chief feature of a cancerous tumour of the breast is its great
hardness. The technical name for the growth is <i>scirrhus</i> (Gr.
<span class="grk" title="skiros">&#963;&#954;&#943;&#961;&#959;&#962;</span>, or <span class="grk" title="skirros">&#963;&#954;&#943;&#961;&#961;&#959;&#962;</span>, any hard coat or covering, <i>stucco</i>), from its stony
hardness. The tumour consists of a dense framework of fibrous
tissue, with groups of cancer-cells in the spaces. The malignancy
of the disease depends upon the cells, not upon the fibrous tissue.
In young subjects the cells predominate, but in old ones the contraction
of the fibrous tissue throughout the breast compresses and
destroys the cells, and this sometimes to such an extent that there
is at last nothing left at the site but contracted fibrous tissue, all
trace of malignancy having disappeared. This variety of the disease
is found in old people, and is called <i>atrophic cancer</i>.</p>

<p>The cells of a cancerous breast are apt to be carried by the lymphatics
to the lymphatic glands in the arm-pit, and by the bloodstream
to the spinal column and to other parts of the skeleton, and
sometimes to the liver, which thus becomes large and hard, or to the
other breast.</p>

<p>As the fibrous tissue around the tumour becomes invaded by the
new growth it undergoes contraction (much as a string becomes
shorter when it is wetted), and as this shortening of the fibrous bands
increases the nipple may be retracted, and the breast may be
closely bound down to the chest-wall; and, further, the skin overlying
the tumour may be drawn in towards the tumour so as to form
a conspicuous dimple. Later, the nutrition of this patch of skin
may be so interfered with that it mortifies or breaks down, and
thus a cancerous ulcer is produced. This ulcer slowly spreads, and
its floor is covered with a discharge in which septic micro-organisms
undergo cultivation; in this way the ulcer becomes highly offensive.
By the use of antiseptic lotions and a frequent change of dressings,
however, all unpleasant smell can be checked or prevented. As the
ulcer extends it is apt to implicate large blood-vessels, so that serious,
and sometimes alarming, haemorrhages take place. And if the breast
had previously been in pain, the bleeding is likely to give great
relief. But repeated haemorrhages bring on increasing exhaustion,
and thus materially hasten the end.</p>

<p>There is at present only one trustworthy treatment for cancer,
and that is its free removal by operation. The entire breast and the
nipple must be sacrificed. At the present day the operation itself
is not a &ldquo;dreadful&rdquo; one. To be successful it must be very thorough,
and it must be done <i>early</i>. The patient, being under an anaesthetic,
feels nothing, and the subsequent dressings of the wound are attended
with scarcely any pain. There need be but a couple of days of confinement
to bed, and when the wound has soundly healed the patient
may be encouraged to use her arm. Should there be recurrence of
cancerous nodules in or about the wound, their removal should be
promptly and widely effected. The writer has records of one case
in which between the first operation and the last report there was a
space of over twenty-nine years, and another of fifteen years. Each
of these patients had one extensive operation, and four or five
smaller operations for dealing with recurrences. Each of them, however,
might be considered unlikely subjects for further return.</p>

<p>For a <i>superficial cancer</i> the X-rays may be of service, but many
applications of the rays are likely to be needed, and the case may
possibly refuse to yield to their influence, and, after loss of valuable
time, the disease may have eventually to be removed by the knife.
The great advantage which the treatment by the knife offers over
every other method is that the growth can be cleanly, efficiently and
promptly removed, and, with it, all the affected lymph-spaces, and
the lymphatic glands which are secondarily implicated.</p>

<p>As regards the value of radium in the treatment of cancer of the
breast, the high expectations which were somewhat widely associated
with this newly-found element early in 1909 must be said to have been
unjustified by any precise results. Injections of radium salts have
been made into the substance of a cancer, and tubes of aluminium
containing the salt have been introduced into the growth, but no
deep cancer has thereby been cured. Radium has also been exposed
again and again on the surface of the affected breast, but similarly
with no great result. Unfortunately, whilst one is experimenting
in the treatment of an operable cancer, the epithelial cells of the
growth may be making their way towards distant parts, where no
rays or emanations could possibly reach them. Whatever may
be the future of radium as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of
cancer of the breast, it is certain that, on the facts as known at the
beginning of 1910, the only safe course is to remove the breast by
direct operation, together with the associated lymph-spaces and
lymphatic glands. And if this is done promptly and thoroughly
cancer of the breast will come more and more into the class of
curable diseases.</p>

and form of the tusks and the characters of the molar teeth,
the farthest removed from the mastodon type, while its nearest
surviving relative, the Asiatic elephant (<i>E. maximus</i>), has
retained the slightly more generalized characters of the mammoth&rsquo;s
contemporaries of more southern climes, <i>E. columbi</i> of
America and <i>E. armeniacus</i> of the Old World. The tusks, or
upper incisor teeth, which were probably smaller in the female,
in the adult males attained the length of from 9 to 10 ft. measured
along the outer curve. Upon leaving the head they were directed
at first downwards, and outwards, then upwards and finally
inwards at the tips, and generally with a tendency to a spiral
form not seen in other elephants.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>It is chiefly by the characters of the molar teeth that the various
extinct modifications of the elephant type are distinguished. Those
of the mammoth (fig. 2) differ from the corresponding organs of
allied species in great breadth of the crown as compared with the
length, the narrowness and crowding or close approximation of the
ridges, the thinness of the enamel, and its straightness, parallelism
and absence of &ldquo;crimping,&rdquo; as seen on the worn surface or in a
horizontal section of the tooth. The molars, as in other elephants,
are six in number on each side above and below, succeeding each
other from before backwards. Of these Dr Falconer gave the prevailing
&ldquo;ridge-formula&rdquo; (or number of complete ridges in each tooth)
as 4, 8, 12, 12, 16, 24, as in <i>E. maximus</i>. Dr Leith-Adams, working
from more abundant materials, has shown that the number of ridges
of each tooth, especially those at the posterior end of the series, is
subject to individual variation, ranging in each tooth of the series
within the following limits: 3 to 4, 6 to 9, 9 to 12, 9 to 15, 14 to 16,
18 to 27&mdash;excluding the small plates, called &ldquo;talons,&rdquo; at each end.
Besides these variations in the number of ridges or plates of which
each tooth is composed, the thickness of the enamel varies so much
as to have given rise to a distinction between a &ldquo;thick-plated&rdquo;
and a &ldquo;thin-plated&rdquo; variety&mdash;the latter being most prevalent
among specimens from the Arctic regions. From the specimens with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page531" id="page531"></a>531</span>
thick enamel plates the transition to the other species mentioned
above, including <i>E. maximus</i>, is almost imperceptible.</p>

<p>The bones of the skeleton generally more resemble those of the
Indian elephant than of any other species, but the skull differs in
the narrower summit, narrower temporal fossae, and more prolonged
incisive sheaths, supporting the roots of the enormous tusks. Among
the external characters by which the mammoth was distinguished
from either of the existing species of elephant was the dense clothing,
not only of long, coarse outer hair, but also of close under woolly
hair of a reddish-brown colour, evidently in adaptation to the
cold climate it inhabited. This character is represented in rude
but graphic drawings of prehistoric age found in caverns in the south
of France. It should be added that young Asiatic elephants often
show considerable traces of the woolly coat of the mammoth.
The average height does not appear to have exceeded that of either
of the existing species of elephant.</p>
</div>

<p>The geographical range of the mammoth was very extensive.
There is scarcely a county in England in which its remains have
not been found in alluvial gravel or in caverns, and numbers of
its teeth are dredged in the North Sea. In Scotland and Ireland
its remains are less abundant, and in Scandinavia and Finland
they appear to be unknown; but they have been found in vast
numbers at various localities throughout the greater part of
central Europe (as far south as Santander and Rome), northern
Asia, and the northern part of the American continent.</p>

<p>The mammoth belongs to the post-Tertiary or Pleistocene
epoch and was contemporaneous with man. There is evidence
to show that it existed in Britain before, during and after the
glacial period. It is in northern Siberia that its remains have
been found in the greatest abundance and in exceptional preservation.
For a long period there has been from that region an
export of mammoth-ivory, fit for commercial purposes, to China
and to Europe. In the middle of the 10th century trade was
carried on at Khiva in fossil ivory. Middendorff estimated the
number of tusks which have yearly come into the market during
the last two centuries at at least a hundred pairs, but Nordenskiöld
considers this estimate too low. Tusks are found along
the whole shore-line between the mouth of the Obi and Bering
Strait, and the farther north the more numerous they become,
the islands of New Siberia being one of the favourite collecting
localities. The remains are found not only round the mouths of
the great rivers, but embedded in the frozen soil in such circumstances
as to indicate that the animals lived not far from the
localities in which they are found; and they are exposed either
by the melting of the ice in warm summers or the washing
away of the sea-cliffs or river-banks. In this way the bodies
of more or less nearly perfect animals, often standing in the
erect position, with the soft parts and hairy covering entire,
have been brought to light.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MAMMOTH CAVE,<a name="ar23" id="ar23"></a></span> a cave in Edmondson county, Kentucky,
U.S.A., 37° 14&prime; N. lat. and 86° 12&prime; W. long., by rail 85 m. S.S.W.
of Louisville. Steamboats run from the mouth of the Green
river, near Evansville, Indiana, to the Mammoth Cave landing.
The cave is usually said to have been discovered, in 1809, by a
hunter named Hutchins; but the county records, as early as 1797,
fixed its entrance as the landmark for
a piece of real estate. Its mouth is
in a forest ravine, 194 ft. above Green
river and 600 ft. above the sea. This
aperture is not the original mouth, the
latter being a chasm a quarter of a
mile north of it, and leading into what
is known as Dixon&rsquo;s cave. The two
portions are not now connected, though
persons in one can make themselves
heard by those in the other.</p>

<p>The cavernous limestone of Kentucky
covers an area of 8000 sq. m., is
massive and homogeneous, and belongs
to the Subcarboniferous period. It
shows few traces of dynamic disturbance,
but has been carved, mainly by erosion
since the Miocene epoch, into many
caverns, of which the Mammoth Cave is
the largest.</p>

<p>The natural arch that admits one to
Mammoth Cave has a span of 70 ft.,
and from a ledge above it a cascade
leaps 59 ft. to the rocks below, where it
disappears. A flight of stone steps
leads the way down to a narrow passage,
through which the air rushes with violence,
outward in summer and inward in
winter. The temperature of the cave is uniformly 54° F. throughout
the year, and the atmosphere is both chemically and optically
of singular purity. While the lower levels are moist from the
large pools and rivers that have secret connexion with Green
river, the upper galleries are extremely dry. These conditions
led at one time to the erection of thirteen cottages at a point
about 1 m. underground, for the use of invalids, especially
consumptives. The experiment failed, and only two cottages
now remain as curiosities.</p>

<p>The Main Cave, from 40 to 300 ft. wide and from 35 to 125 ft.
high, has several vast rooms, <i>e.g.</i> the Rotunda, where are the
ruins of the old saltpetre works; the Star Chamber, where the
protrusion of white crystals through a coating of the black oxide
of manganese creates an optical illusion of great beauty; the Chief
City, where an area of 2 acres is covered by a vault 125 ft. high,
and the floor is strewn with rocky fragments, among which are
found numerous half-burnt torches made of canes, and other signs
of prehistoric occupancy. Two skeletons were exhumed near the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page532" id="page532"></a>532</span>
Rotunda; but few other bones of any description have been found.
The so-called Mammoth Cave &ldquo;mummies&rdquo; (<i>i.e.</i> bodies kept by
being inhumed in nitrous earth), with accompanying utensils,
ornaments, braided sandals and other relics, were found in Short
and Salt Caves near by, and removed to Mammoth Cave for
exhibition. The Main Cave, which abruptly ends 4 m. from the
entrance, is joined by winding passages, with spacious galleries
on different levels; and, although the diameter of the area of the
whole cavern is less than 10 m., the <span class="correction" title="amended from conbined">combined</span> length of all
accessible avenues is supposed to be about 150 m.</p>

<div class="center ptb2"><img style="width:1081px; height:885px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img532.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>The chief points of interest are arranged along two lines of
exploration, besides which there are certain side excursions.
The &ldquo;short route&rdquo; requires about four hours, and the &ldquo;long
route&rdquo; nine. Audubon&rsquo;s Avenue, the one nearest the entrance,
is occupied in winter by myriads of bats, that hang from the walls
in clusters like swarms of bees. The Gothic Avenue contains
numerous large stalactites and stalagmites, and an interesting
place called the Chapel, and ends in a double dome and cascade.
Among the most surprising features of cave scenery are the vertical
shafts that pierce through all levels, from the uppermost
galleries, or even from the sink-holes, down to the lowest floor.
These are styled pits or domes, according to the position occupied
by the observer. A crevice behind a block of stone, 40 ft. long by
20 ft. wide, called the Giant&rsquo;s Coffin, admits the explorer to
a place where six pits, varying in depth from 65 ft. to 200 ft.,
exist in an area of 600 yds. This includes Gorin&rsquo;s Dome, which
is viewed from a point midway in its side, and also from its top,
and was formerly regarded as the finest room in the cavern.
Others admire more the Mammoth Dome, at the termination of
Spark&rsquo;s Avenue, where a cataract falls from a height of 150 ft.
amid walls wonderfully draped with stalactitic tapestry. The
Egyptian Temple, which is a continuation of the Mammoth
Dome, contains six massive columns, two of them quite perfect
and 80 ft. high and 25 ft. in diameter. The combined length of
these contiguous chambers is 400 ft. By a crevice above they
are connected with an arm of Audubon&rsquo;s Avenue. Lucy&rsquo;s
Dome, one of the group of Jessup Domes, is supposed to be the
loftiest of all these vertical shafts. A pit called the &ldquo;Maelstrom,&rdquo;
in Croghan&rsquo;s Hall, is the spot most remote from the mouth of
the cave. There are some fine stalactites near this pit, and
others in the Fairy Grotto and in Pensico Avenue; but, considering
the magnitude of Mammoth Cave, its poverty of stalactitic
ornamentation is remarkable. The wealth of crystals is, however,
surprising, and these are of endless variety and fantastic
beauty.</p>

<p>Cleveland&rsquo;s Cabinet and Marion&rsquo;s Avenue, each a mile long,
are adorned by myriads of gypsum rosettes and curiously
twisted crystals, called &ldquo;oulopholites.&rdquo; These cave flowers
are unfolded by pressure, as if a sheaf were forced through a
tight binding, or the crystal fibres curl outward from the centre
of the group. Thus spotless arches of 50 ft. span are embellished
by floral clusters and garlands, hiding nearly every foot of
the grey limestone. The botryoidal formations hanging by
thousands in Mary&rsquo;s Vineyard resemble mimic clusters of grapes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page533" id="page533"></a>533</span>
as the oulopholites resemble roses. Again, there are chambers
with drifts of snowy crystals of the sulphate of magnesia, the
ceilings so thickly covered with their efflorescence that a loud
concussion will cause them to fall like flakes of snow.</p>

<p>Many small rooms and tortuous paths, where nothing of
special interest can be found, are avoided as much as possible
on the regular routes; but certain disagreeable experiences are
inevitable. There is peril also in the vicinity of the deep pits.
The one known as the Bottomless Pit was for many years a
barrier to all further exploration, but it is now crossed by a
wooden bridge. Long before the shaft had been cut as deep as
now the water flowed away by a channel gradually contracting to
a serpentine way, so extremely narrow as to be called the Fat
Man&rsquo;s Misery. The walls, only 18 in. apart, change direction eight
times in 105 yds., while the distance from the sandy path to the
ledge overhead is but 5 ft. The rocky sides are finely marked
with waves and ripples, as if running water had suddenly been
petrified. This winding way conducts one to River Hall, beyond
which lie the crystalline gardens that have been described. It
used to be said that, if this narrow passage were blocked up,
escape would be impossible; but an intricate web of fissures,
called the Corkscrew, has been discovered, by means of which a
good climber, ascending only a few hundred feet, lands 1000 yds.
from the mouth of the cave, and cuts off one or two miles.</p>

<p>The waters, entering through numerous domes and pits, and
falling, during the rainy season, in cascades of great volume, are
finally collected in River Hall, where they form several extensive
lakes, or rivers, whose connexion with Green River is known to be
in deep springs appearing under arches on its margin. Whenever
there is a freshet in Green River the streams in the cave are
joined in a continuous body of water, the rise sometimes being
60 ft. above the low-water mark. The subsidence within is less
rapid than the rise; and the streams are impassable for about
seven months in each year. They are navigable from May to
October, and furnish interesting features of cave scenery. The
first approach is called the Dead Sea, embraced by cliffs 60 ft. high
and 100 ft. long, above which a path has been made, whence a stairway
leads down to the banks of the river Styx, a body of water
40 ft. long, crossed by a natural bridge. Lake Lethe comes next&mdash;a
broad basin enclosed by walls 90 ft. high, below which a narrow
path leads to a pontoon at the neck of the lake. A beach of the
finest yellow sand extends for 500 yds. to Echo River, the largest
of all being from 20 to 200 ft. wide, 10 to 40 ft. deep and about
three-quarters of a mile long. It is crossed by boats. The
arched passage-way is very symmetrical, varying in height from
19 to 35 ft., and famous for its musical reverberations&mdash;not a
distinct echo, but an harmonious prolongation of sound for from
10 to 30 seconds after the original tone is produced. The long
vault has a certain keynote of its own, which, when firmly struck,
excites harmonics, including tones of incredible depth and
sweetness.</p>

<p>There are several other streams here besides those in River
Hall. On one of them F. J. Stevenson of London is said to have
floated for seven hours without finding its end. A glance at the
accompanying map will show that there is a labyrinth of avenues
and chasms seldom visited and never fully explored. New discoveries
are frequently made. An exploring party in 1904 found
a curious complex of upper and lower galleries accessible from
the most eastern portion of the cave; beyond which another
party, in 1905, discovered several large domes previously unknown.
H. C. Hovey, in 1907, was led by expert guides into still
wilder recesses, where a series of five domes were found, that
opened into each other by tall gateways; each dome being 60 ft.
in diameter and 175 ft. high. This magnificent group has
since been named &ldquo;Hovey&rsquo;s Cathedral Domes.&rdquo; No instrumental
survey of the Mammoth Cave has ever been allowed by the
management. The best map possible is therefore only the
result of estimates and partial measurements. The depths of
the most noted pits have easily been ascertained by line and
plummet and the height of several large domes has been found
by the use of small balloons. While making a survey exclusively
for the cave-owners in 1908, Max Kaemper of Berlin, Germany,
forced an opening from the main cave into a remarkable region
to which the general name of &ldquo;Violet City&rdquo; was given, in honour
of Mrs Violet Blair Janin, who owned a third of the Mammoth
Cave estate. Special features are Kaemper Hall, Blair Castle,
the Marble Temple and Walhalla. There are eleven enormous
pits, many large fine stalactites and stalagmites and surprisingly
beautiful mural decorations. Dr Hovey made and published
(1909) a new handbook embodying all known discoveries of
importance, with four sketch-maps of the routes of usual
exhibition.</p>

<p>The fauna of Mammoth Cave has been classified by F. W. Putnam,
A. S. Packard and E. D. Cope, who have catalogued twenty-eight
species truly subterraneous, besides those that may be regarded
as stragglers from the surface. They are distributed thus:
<i>Vertebrata</i>, 8 species; <i>Insecta</i>, 17; <i>Arachnida</i>, 12; <i>Myriapoda</i>, 2;
<i>Crustacea</i>, 5; <i>Vermes</i>, 3; <i>Mollusca</i>, 1. Ehrenberg adds a list of
8 Polygastric <i>Infusoria</i>, 1 fossil infusorian, 5 <i>Phytolitharia</i> and
several microscopic fungi. A bed of <i>Agaricus</i> was found by the
writer near the river Styx; and upon this hint an attempt has
been made to propagate edible fungi in this locality. All the
known forms of plant-life are either fungi or allied to them, and
many are only microscopic. The most interesting inhabitants
of Mammoth Cave are the blind, wingless grasshoppers, with
extremely long antennae; blind, colourless crayfish (<i>Cambarus
pellucidus</i>, Telk.); and the blind fish, <i>Amblyopsis spelaeus</i>,
colourless and viviparous, from 1 in. to 6 in. long. The <i>Cambarus</i>
and <i>Amblyopsis</i> have wide distribution, being found in many
other caves, and also in deep wells, in Kentucky and Indiana.
Fish not blind are occasionally caught, which are apparently
identical with species existing in streams outside. The true
subterranean fauna may be regarded as chiefly of Pleistocene
origin; yet certain forms are possibly remnants of Tertiary
life.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MAMORÉ,<a name="ar24" id="ar24"></a></span> a large river of Bolivia which unites with the Beni
in 10° 20&prime; S. to form the Madeira, one of the largest tributaries
of the Amazon. It rises on the northern slope of the Sierra
de Cochabamba east of the city of Cochabamba, and is known as
the Chimoré down to its junction with the Chapare, or Chapari.
Its larger tributaries are the Chapare, Sécure, Apere and Yacuma
from the west, and the Ichila, Guapay or Grande, Ivari and
Guaporé from the east. Taking into account its length only, the
Guapay should be considered the upper part of the Mamoré;
but it is shallow and obstructed, and carries a much smaller
volume of water. The Guaporé, or Itenez, also rivals the Mamoré
in length and volume, having its source in the Serra dos Parecis,
Matto Grosso, Brazil, a few miles from streams flowing northward
to the Tapajos and Amazon, and southward to the Paraguay
and Paraná. The Mamoré is interrupted by rapids a few miles
above its junction with the Beni, but a railway 180 m. long has
been undertaken from below the rapids of the Madeira. Above
the rapids the river is navigable to Chimoré, at the foot of the
<i>sierra</i>, and most of its tributaries are navigable for long distances.
Franz Keller (in <i>The Amazon and Madeira Rivers</i>; New York,
1874) gives the outflow of the Mamoré at mean water level, and
not including the Guaporé, as 2530 cub. in. per second, and the
area of its drainage basin, also not including the Guaporé, as
9382 sq. m.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MAMUN<a name="ar25" id="ar25"></a></span> (<i>c.</i> 786-833), originally <span class="sc">Abdallah</span>, surnamed <span class="sc">Al-Ma&rsquo;m&#363;n</span>
(&ldquo;in whom men trust&rdquo;), the seventh of the Abbasid
caliphs of Bagdad, was born about <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 786, and was the second
son of Harun al-Rash&#299;d. By Harun&rsquo;s will he was successor-designate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page534" id="page534"></a>534</span>
to his brother Amin, during whose reign he was to be
governor of the eastern part of the empire. On Harun&rsquo;s death
(809) Amin succeeded and Mamun acquiesced. Irritated, however,
by the treatment he received from Amin, and supported by
a portion of the army, Mamun speedily rebelled. A five years&rsquo;
struggle between the two brothers ended in the death of Amin
and the proclamation of Mamun as caliph at Bagdad (Sept. 813).
Various factions and revolts, which disturbed the first years of his
reign, were readily quelled by his prudent and energetic measures.
But a much more serious rebellion, stirred up by his countenancing
the heretical sect of Ali and adopting their colours,
soon after threatened his throne. His crown was actually on
the head of his uncle Ibrahim b. Mahdi (surnamed Mobarek)
for a short time (Barbier de Meynard, in <i>Journal Asiatique</i>,
March-April 1869). This inaugurated a period of tranquillity,
which Mamun employed in fostering literature and science. He
had already, while governor of Khorasan, founded a college
there, and attracted to it the most eminent men of the day, and
Bagdad became the seat of academical instruction. At his own
expense he caused to be translated into Arabic many valuable
books from the Greek, Persian, Chaldean and Coptic languages;
and he was himself an ardent student of mathematics and
astronomy. The first Arabic translation of Euclid was dedicated
to him in 813. Mamun founded observatories at Bagdad and
Kassiun (near Damascus), and succeeded in determining the
inclination of the ecliptic. He also caused a degree of the meridian
to be measured on the plain of Shinar; and he constructed
astronomical tables, which are said to be wonderfully accurate.</p>

<p>In 827 he was converted to the heterodox faith of the Mo&rsquo;tazilites,
who asserted the free-will of man and denied the eternity
of the Koran. The later years (829-830) of his reign were distracted
by hostilities with the Greek emperor Theophilus, while
a series of revolts in different parts of the Arabian empire betokened
the decline of the military glory of the caliphs. Spain
and part of Africa had already asserted their independence, and
Egypt and Syria were now inclined to follow. In 833, after
quelling Egypt, at least nominally, Mamun marched into Cilicia
to prosecute the war with the Greeks, but died near Tarsus,
leaving his crown to a younger brother, Motasim. The death of
Mamun ended an important epoch in the history of science and
letters and the period of Arabian prosperity which his father&rsquo;s
reign had begun.</p>

England, in the Irish Sea. (For map, see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">England</a></span>, section I.)
It is about 33 m. long by about 12 broad in the broadest part. Its
general form resembles that of an heraldic lozenge, though its outline
is very irregular, being indented with numerous bays and
narrow creeks. Its chief physical characteristic is the close
juxtaposition of mountain, glen and sea, which has produced a
variety and beauty of scenery unsurpassed in any area of equal
size elsewhere.</p>

<p>The greater part of its surface is hilly. The hills, which reach
their culminating point in Snaefell (2034 ft.), have a definite
tendency to trend in the direction of the longer axis, but throw
out many radiating spurs, which frequently extend to the
coast-line. They are, for the most part, smooth and rounded
in outline, the rocks being such as do not favour the formation
of crags, though, owing to the rapidity of their descent,
streams have frequently rent steep-walled craggy gulleys in
their sides. The strength of the prevalent westerly winds has
caused them to be treeless, except in some of the lower slopes,
but they are clad with verdure to their summits. Rising almost
directly from the sea, they appear higher than they really are,
and therefore present a much more imposing appearance than
many hills of greater altitude. On the south-west, where they
descend precipitously into the sea, they unite with the cliffs
to the north and south of them to produce the most striking
part of the coast scenery for which the isle is remarkable. But,
indeed, the whole coast from Peel round by the Calf, past Castletown
and Douglas to Maughold Head, near Ramsey, is distinguished
by rugged grandeur. From Ramsey round by the Point
of Ayre to within a few miles of Peel extend low sandy cliffs,
bordered by flat sandy shores, which surround the northern plain.
This plain is relieved only by a low range of hills, the highest of
which attains an elevation of 270 ft. The drainage of the island
radiates from the neighbourhood of Snaefell, from which mountain
and its spurs streams have on all sides found their way to
the sea. The most important of these are the Sulby, falling into
the sea at Ramsey; the <i>Awin-glass</i> (bright river) and the <i>Awin-dhoo</i>
(dark river), which unite their waters near Douglas; the <i>Neb</i>,
at the mouth of which Peel is situated; and the <i>Awin-argid</i>
(silver river, now called the Silverburn), which joins the sea
at Castletown. There are no lakes. The narrow, winding
glens thus formed, which are studded with clumps of fir, sycamore
and mountain ash, interspersed with patches of gorse,
heather and fern, afford a striking and beautiful contrast to the
bare mountain tops. Traces of an older system of drainage
than that which now exists are noticeable in many places, the
most remarkable being the central depression between Douglas
and Peel. The chief bays are, on the east coast, Ramsey, with
an excellent anchorage, Laxey, Douglas, Derbyhaven, Castletown
and Port St Mary; and, on the west coast, Port Erin and Peel.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Geology.</i>&mdash;The predominant feature in the stratigraphy of the
Isle of Man is, in the words of G. W. Lamplough,<a name="fa1c" id="fa1c" href="#ft1c"><span class="sp">1</span></a> &ldquo;the central
ridge of slate and greywacke, which seems to have constituted an
insulated tract at as early a date as the beginning of the Carboniferous
period. This prototype of the present island appears afterwards
to have been enfolded and obliterated by the sediments of
later times; but with the progress of denudation the old ridge has
once more emerged from beneath this mantle.&rdquo; This mass of
ancient rocks, the Manx Slate Series, has been divided locally into
the Barrule slates, the Agneesh and other grit beds; and the Lonan
and Niarbyl Flags. The whole series strikes N.E.-S.W., while
structurally the strata form part of a synclinorium, the higher beds
being on the N.W. and S.E. sides of the islands, the lower beds in
the interior; although the subordinate dips appear to indicate
an anticlinal structure. These rocks have been greatly crumpled;
and in places, notably in Sully Glen, thrusting has developed a well-marked
crush-breccia. So much has this folding and compression
toughened the soft argillaceous rocks that the Barrule Slate, for
example, is almost everywhere found occupying the highest points
while the hard but more joined grits and flags occupy the lower
ground on the mountain flanks. The Manx Series is penetrated and
altered by large masses of granite at Dhoon, Foxdale and one or
two other spots; and dykes, more or less directly associated with
these masses, are numerous. No satisfactory fossils have yet been
obtained from these rocks, but they are regarded, provisionally, as
of Upper Cambrian age. Carboniferous rocks, including a basal
conglomerate, white limestone with abundant fossils, and the black
&ldquo;Posidonomya Beds&rdquo; (some of which are polished as a black marble)
occur about Castletown, Poolvash Bay and Langness; and the basement
beds appear again on the west coast at Peel. The cliffs and
foreshore at Scarlet Point exhibit contemporaneous Carboniferous
tuffs, agglomerates and basalts, as well as later dolerite dykes, in
a most striking manner. Here too may be seen some curious effects
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page535" id="page535"></a>535</span>
of thrusting in the limestones. At the northern end of the island
the Manx Slates end abruptly in an ancient sea-cliff which crosses
between Ramsey and Ballaugh. The low-lying country beyond
is formed of a thick mass of glacial sands, gravels and boulder clay.
In the Bride Hills are to be seen glacial mounds rising 150 ft. above
the level of the plain. The depressions known as the Curragh, now
drained but still peaty in places, probably represent the sites of late
glacial lakes. Glacial deposits are found also in all parts of the
island. Beneath the thick drift of the plain, Carboniferous, Permian
and Trassic rocks have been proved to lie at some depth below the
present sea-level. On the coast near the Point of Ayr is a raised
beach. Silver-bearing lead ore, zinc and copper are the principal
minerals found in the Isle of Man; the most important mining centres
being at Foxdale and Laxey.</p>

<p><i>Climate.</i>&mdash;The island is liable to heavy gales from the south-west.
Of this the trend of the branches of the trees to the north-east is a
striking testimony. But it is equally subject to the influence of the
warm drift from the Atlantic, so that its winters are mild, and, influenced
by the less changeable temperature of the sea, its summers
cool. The mean annual temperature is 49°.0 F., the temperature of the
coldest month (January) being 41°.5, and the warmest (August) 58°.5,
giving an extreme annual range of temperature of 17°.1 only, while the
average temperature in spring is 46°.0, in summer 57°.2, in autumn
50°.9 and in winter 42°.0. Further evidence of the mildness of the
climate is afforded by the fact that fuchsias, hydrangeas, myrtles and
escallonias grow luxuriantly in the open air. Its rainfall, placed as it is
between mountain districts in England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales,
is naturally rather wet than dry. Statistics, however, reveal remarkable
divergencies in the amounts of rain in the different parts of the
island, varying from 61 in. at Snaefell to 25 in. at the Calf of Man.
In the more populous districts it varies from 46 in. at Ramsey, and
45 in. at Douglas, to 38 in. at Peel and 34 in. at Castletown. Of
sunshine the Isle of Man has a larger share than any portion of the
United Kingdom except the south and south-east coasts and the
Channel Islands. Briefly, then, the climate of the island may be
pronounced to be equable and sunny, and, though humid, decidedly
invigorating; its rainfall, though it varies greatly, is excessive in
the populous districts; and its winds are strong and frequent, and
usually mild and damp.</p>

<p><i>Fauna.</i>&mdash;Like Ireland, the Isle of Man is exempt from snakes
and toads, a circumstance traditionally attributed to the agency of
St Patrick, the patron saint of both islands. Frogs, however, have
been introduced from Ireland, and both the sand lizard and the common
lizard are found. Badgers, moles, squirrels and voles are absent
and foxes are extinct. Fossil bones of the Irish elk are frequently
found, and a complete skeleton of this animal is to be seen at Castle
Rushen. The red deer, which is referred to in the ancient laws and
pictured on the runic crosses, became extinct by the beginning of
the 18th century. Hares are less plentiful than formerly, and rabbits
are not very numerous. Snipe are fairly common, and there are a
few partridges and grouse. The latter, which had become extinct,
were reintroduced in 1880. Woodcock, wild geese, wild ducks,
plover, widgeon, teal, heron, bittern, kingfishers and the Manx
shearwater (<i>Puffinus anglorum</i>) visit the island, but do not breed
there. The puffin (<i>Fratercula artica</i>) is still numerous on the Calf
islet in the summer time. The peregrine falcon, which breeds on
the rocky coast, and the chough have become very scarce. The
legal protection of sea-birds (local act of 1867) has led to an enormous
increase in the number of gulls. A variety of the domestic cat,
remarkable for the absence or stunted condition of the tail, is peculiar
to the island.</p>

<p><i>Flora.</i>&mdash;Like the fauna, the flora is chiefly remarkable for its
meagreness. It contains at most 450 species as compared with 690
in Jersey. Alpine forms are absent. But what it lacks in variety
it makes up in beauty and quantity. For the profusion of the gorse-bloom
and the abundance of spring flowers, especially of primroses,
and of ferns, the Isle of Man is probably unrivalled.</p>
</div>

<p><i>People.</i>&mdash;The Manx people of the present day are mainly of
Scandio-Celtic origin, with some slight traces of earlier races.
They have large and broad heads, usually broader than those of
their brother Celts (<i>Goidels</i>) in Ireland and Scotland, with very
broad, but not specially prominent cheek-bones. Their faces
are usually either scutiform, like those of the Northmen, or oval,
which is the usual Celtic type, and their noses are almost always
of good length, and straighter than is general among Celtic races.
Light eyes and fair complexion, with rather dark hair, are the more
usual combinations. They are usually rather tall and heavily
built, their average height (males) being 5 ft. 7½ in., and average
weight (naked) 155 &#8468;. The tendency of the population to
increase is balanced by emigration. It reached its maximum in
1891. Since then it has slightly declined. A noticeable feature
is its greater proportionate growth in the towns, especially in
Douglas, than in the country. The country population reached
its maximum in 1851. Since then it has been shrinking rapidly,
especially in the northern district.</p>

<p><i>Chief Political Divisions and Towns.</i>&mdash;The island is divided into
six sheadings (so named from the Scandinavian <i>skeða-Þing</i>, or
ship-district), called Glenfaba, Middle, Rushen, Garff, Ayre and
Michael, each of which has its officer, the coroner, whose functions
are similar to those of a sheriff; and there are seventeen parishes.
For the towns see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Castletown</a></span>, <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Douglas</a></span>, <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Peel</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Ramsey</a></span>.
The principal villages are Ballasalla, Ballaugh, Foxdale, Laxey,
Michael, Onchan, Port Erin and Port St Mary.</p>

<p><i>Communications.</i>&mdash;There is communication by steamer with
Liverpool, Glasgow, Greenock, Belfast, Silloth, Whitehaven, Belfast
and Dublin throughout the year and, during the summer season,
there are also steamers plying to Androssan, Heysham, Fleetwood
and Blackpool. A daily mail was established in 1879. The internal
communications are excellent. The roads are under the management
of a board appointed by the Tynwald Court, a surveyor-general,
and parochial surveyors. They are maintained by a system of
licences on public-houses, carriages, carts and dogs, and a rate on
real property. There are railways between Douglas, Ramsey,
Peel, Castletown, Port Erin and Port St Mary, the line between
Douglas and Ramsey being via St John&rsquo;s and Michael. Electric
tramways run from Douglas to Ramsey via Laxey, from Douglas
to Port Soderick, and from Laxey to the summit of Snaefell.</p>

<p><i>Industries.</i> (<i>a</i>) <i>Agriculture.</i>&mdash;The position of the Manx farmers,
though they generally pay higher rents than their compeers in
those countries do, is, except in the remote parts of the island, more
favourable than that of the English or Scottish farmers. The best
land is in the north and south. The farms are principally held on
lease and small holdings have almost entirely disappeared. The
cultivated area is about 93,000 acres, or 65% of the whole. The
commons and uncultivated lands on the mountains are also utilized
for pasturage. Oats occupy about three-fourths of the area under
corn crops, barley about one-sixth. The amount of wheat and other
corn crops is very trifling. Neither Manx wheat nor barley is as
good on an average as English; but oats is, on the whole, fully equal
to what is grown on the mainland. Turnips, which are an excellent
crop, are largely exported, and the dry and sandy soil of the north
of the island is very favourable for the growth of potatoes. The
white and red clover and the common grasses grow luxuriantly,
and the pasturage is, generally speaking, good. Some of the low-lying
land, especially in the north, is much in need of systematic
drainage. The livestock, largely in consequence of the premiums
given by the insular government and the local agricultural society
to bulls, heavy and light stallions and cart mares, now approximates
very closely in quality to the stock in the north of England. Dairying,
owing to the large number of summer visitors, is the most profitable
department of agricultural industry. Apples, pears and wall
fruit do not succeed very well, but the soil is favourable for the
cultivation of strawberries, raspberries, gooseberries, currants and
vegetables. Both agricultural and market-garden produce are
quite insufficient to supply the demand in the summer.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Fishing.</i>&mdash;The important place which the fishing industry
anciently held in the social organization of the Isle of Man is quaintly
reflected in the wording of the oath formerly taken by the deemsters,
who promised to execute the laws between the sovereign and his
subjects, and &ldquo;betwixt party and party, as indifferently as the
herring backbone doth lie in the midst of the fish.&rdquo; The statutes and
records abound in evidence of the great extent to which both the
people and their rulers were dependent on the produce of the sea.
The most numerous fish are herrings, cod, mackerel, ling, haddock,
plaice, sole, fluke, turbot and brett. The industry is, however, in a
decaying condition, especially the herring fishery, which, for reasons
which have not been satisfactorily ascertained, fails periodically. The
amount of fish caught, except herrings, is not sufficient to supply
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page536" id="page536"></a>536</span>
the local demand in the summer, though some of the fish named
are exported during the rest of the year. About 250 vessels, aggregating
4260 tons, with crews numbering 4250, are employed in this
industry. A fish hatchery has been established at Port Erin by the
insular government.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>Mining.</i>&mdash;There is no doubt that, in proportion to its area,
the metalliferous wealth of the Isle of Man has been very considerable.
Two of its mines, Laxey and Foxdale, have stood for a long
series of years in the first rank in the British Islands for productiveness
of zinc and silver lead respectively. These metals have constituted
its principal riches, but copper pyrites and hematite iron have
also been raised in marketable quantities, while only very small
amounts of the ores of nickel and antimony have been found. The
mines are rented from the Crown as lord of the manor. The value
of the ore produced is about £40,000 annually. Other economic
products are clay, granite, limestone, sandstone, slate (of an inferior
quality) and salt, which has been discovered near the Point of
Ayre.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) <i>Textiles, &amp;c</i>.&mdash;Since labour has become scarcer and dearer
textile industries have been declining, being unable to compete with
larger and more completely organized manufactories elsewhere.
The principal manufactured articles are woollen cloths and blankets,
hemp ropes and cotton, and herring nets. A few fishing vessels
are built, and brewing is a prosperous industry. But, apart from
agriculture, the most important industry (for so it may be called)
is that of the provision for summer visitors, nearly half a million of
whom come to the island annually.</p>

<p><i>Commerce</i>.&mdash;The chief exports are lead, zinc, turnips, ropes,
cotton nets and salt. The imports consist chiefly of timber, provisions,
livestock, poultry, flour, fruit, vegetables and eggs. In
1906 the tonnage of vessels (other than fishing or wind-bound vessels)
cleared for traffic was 720,790. The number of vessels (other than
fishing vessels) registered as belonging to the island in 1906 was 79.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Government</i>.&mdash;The government of the island is vested in a
lieutenant-governor, appointed by the Crown; in a Council,
which is the upper branch of the legislature; in the House of
Keys, which is the lower branch; and in the Tynwald Court.
The Council and Keys sit separately as legislative bodies,
but they sit in the Tynwald Court as distinct bodies with
co-ordinate powers to transact executive business and to sign
Bills. The Tynwald Court controls the surplus revenue, after
the payment of the cost of government and of a fixed contribution
of £10,000 to the imperial exchequer, subject to the supervision
of the Treasury and the veto of the lieutenant-governor,
and it appoints boards to manage the harbours, highways, education,
local government, and lunatic and poor asylums. The
Imperial government, after intimating its intention to Tynwald,
fixes the rates of the customs duties, but Tynwald can by resolution
&ldquo;impose, abolish or vary&rdquo; the customs duties subject to
the approval of parliament or the Treasury, such change to take
effect immediately and to continue for six months, and, if parliament
be then sitting, to the end of the session, provided that the
same be not in the meantime annulled by the passing of an act
of parliament, or a Treasury minute. The approval of the
sovereign of the United Kingdom in Council is essential to every
legislative enactment. Acts of the imperial parliament do not
affect the island except it be specially named in them. The
lieutenant-governor, who is the representative of the sovereign,
presides in the Council, in the Tynwald Court, in the High
Court of Justice (Staff of Government division) and in the Court
of General Gaol Delivery. He is the supreme executive authority,
and he shares the control of the legislative and administrative
functions, including the management of the revenue and
the control of its surplus, with the Tynwald Court; he has also
the power of veto as regards the disposal of surplus revenue and
the nature of proposed harbour works, and his signature is
necessary to the validity of all acts. It has been the practice
for him to act as chancellor of the exchequer and to initiate all
questions concerning the raising or expenditure of public funds.
The Council consists of the lieutenant-governor, the lord-bishop
of the diocese, the clerk of the rolls, the two deemsters, the
attorney-general, the archdeacon (all of whom are appointed by
the Crown) and the vicar-general, who is appointed by the bishop.
No act of the governor and Council is valid unless it is the act
of the governor and at least two members of the Council.
The House of Keys (for origin of the name see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Key</a></span>) is one of the
most ancient legislative assemblies in the world. It consists
of twenty-four members, elected by male and female owners or
occupiers of property. Each of the six sheadings elects three
members; the towns of Castletown, Peel and Ramsey one each,
and Douglas five. There is no property qualification required
of the members, and the house sits for five years unless
previously dissolved by the lieutenant-governor.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Law</i>.&mdash;The High Court of Justice, of which the lieutenant-governor
is president, contains three divisions: viz. the Chancery Division,
in which the clerk of the rolls sits as judge, the Common Law Division,
of which the deemsters are the judges, the Staff of Government
Division, in which the governor and three judges sit together.
The jurisdiction of the Chancery and Common Law Division is
in the main similar to that of the corresponding divisions in the
English Courts. The Staff of Government exercises appellate
jurisdiction, similar to that of the Appeal Courts in England. The
Common Law Courts for the southern division of the island are
held at Douglas and Castletown alternately and those for the northern
division at Ramsey, once in three months. Actions in these
courts are heard by a deemster and a special or common jury.
The Chancery Court sits once a fortnight at Douglas. The deemsters
also have summary jurisdiction in matters of debt, actions for
liquidated damages under £50, suits for possession of real or personal
property, petitions for probate, &amp;c. These courts, called Deemsters&rsquo;
Courts, are held weekly, alternately at Douglas and Castletown,
by the deemster for the southern division of the island, and at Ramsey
and Peel by the deemster for the northern division. Criminal
cases are heard by the magistrates or a high-bailiff and are (with the
exception of minor cases which may be dealt with summarily) sent
on by them for trial by a deemster and a jury of six, who hear the
evidence and determine whether there is sufficient ground for sending
the case for trial before the Court of General Gaol Delivery, thus
discharging the functions of the Grand Jury in England. The
Court of General Gaol Delivery is the Supreme Criminal Court and is
presided over by the lieutenant-governor, who is assisted by the clerk
of the rolls and the two deemsters. The high-bailiffs hold weekly
courts in the four towns for the recovery of debts under forty shillings
and for the trial of cases usually brought before a stipendiary magistrate
in England. The magistrates (J.P.&rsquo;s) also hold regular courts
in the towns for the trial of breaches of the peace and minor offences.
There is a coroner in each of the six sheadings. These officers are
appointed annually by the lieutenant-governor and perform duties
similar to those of a sheriff&rsquo;s officer in England. Inquests of death
are held by a high-bailiff and jury. The Manx Bar is distinct from
that of England. Its members, called &ldquo;Advocates,&rdquo; combine the
functions of barrister and solicitor. The laws relating to real property
still retain much of their ancient peculiarity, but other branches
of law have of late years by various acts of Tynwald been made
practically identical with English law.</p>

<p>As regards real property the general tenure is a customary freehold
devolving from each possessor to his next heir-at-law. The descent
of land follows the same rules as the descent of the crown of England.
The right of primogeniture extends to females in default of males
in the direct line. The interest of a widow or widower, being the
first wife or husband of a person deceased, is a life estate in one-half
of the lands which have descended hereditarily, and is forfeited by a
second marriage; a second husband or second wife is only entitled
to a life interest in one-fourth, if there be issue of the first marriage.
Of the land purchased by the husband the wife surviving him is
entitled to a life interest in one moiety. By a statute of the year
1777 proprietors of land are empowered to grant leases for any term
not exceeding twenty-one years in possession without the consent
of the wife.</p>

<p><i>Church</i>.&mdash;It is not known by whom Christianity was introduced
into Man, but from the large proportion of names of Irish ecclesiastics
surviving in the appellations of the old Manx <i>keeills</i>, or cells, which
are of similar type to the Irish oratories of the 6th and 7th centuries,
and in the dedications of the parish churches, which are usually on
ancient sites, it may be reasonably conjectured that Manxmen were,
for the most part, Christianized by Irish missionaries. During the
incursions of the pagan Vikings Christianity was almost certainly
extirpated and it was probably not reintroduced before the beginning
of the 11th century. The two most important events in the
history of the medieval Manx Church were the formation of the
diocese of <i>Sodor</i> (<i>q.v.</i>) and the foundation of the abbey of Rushen,
a branch of the Cistercian abbey of Furness, in 1134. This latter
event was important because the Cistercians were exempted from all
episcopal visitation and control, by charter granted by the pope,
and were, therefore, only subject to his rule and that of the abbots
of their own order. From this time till the Reformation we find
that there was an almost continuous struggle between the laity
and the spiritual barons and monks, who had obtained great power
and much property in the island. In 1458 the diocese was placed
under York. The dissolution of the religious houses in Man was not
brought about by the English Act of 1539, which did not apply to the
island, but by the arbitrary action of Henry VIII. From such
evidence as is available it would seem that the Reformation was a
very slow process. When Isaac Barrow (uncle of his well-known
namesake) became bishop in 1663 the condition of the Church was

Wilson (1698-1755) and Mark Hildesley (1755-1773). it attained to a
very much higher level than the English Church during the same
period. After Hildesley&rsquo;s time it was again neglected, and successful
missions by John Wesley and others resulted in the establishment and
rapid increase of Nonconformity. It was not till the second decade
of the 19th century that the condition of the Church began to improve
again, and this improvement has steadily continued. In 1878
a Sodor and Man theological school was established for the training
of candidates for holy orders. This school has been affiliated to
Durham University. In 1880 four rural deaneries were established,
and commissioners were constituted as trustees of endowments for
Church purposes. In 1895 a cathedral chapter, with four canons,
was constituted under the name of the &ldquo;Dean and Chapter of Man,&rdquo;
the bishop being the dean of the cathedral church. A Church Sustentation
Fund was established by Bishop Straton in 1894, with a
view to supplementing the incomes of the clergy, which had been
greatly reduced on account of the low price of corn. There have
been several acts giving Nonconformists equal rights with Churchmen.
Among these are the Burials Acts of 1881 and 1895, which
permit burials to take place in churchyards without the rites of the
Church of England, and allow any burial service, provided it be
Christian, in mortuary chapels. At the present day Nonconformists,
chiefly Wesleyan Methodists, probably outnumber Churchmen,
and there is a small number of Roman Catholics and Presbyterians.
The bishop, who has a seat, but not a vote, in the House of Lords,
is assisted by an archdeacon, a vicar-general, a registrar and a
sumner-general. The jurisdiction of the only remaining ecclesiastical
court, which is presided over by the vicar-general, as representing
the bishop, is mainly in connexion with affiliation questions, the
swearing-in of churchwardens and the granting of faculties. The
power of the Manx Convocation to make canons, though not exercised
since 1704, has never been abrogated, and so far affords a token
that the Manx Church is a separate national Church governed by its
own laws, which, however, must be approved by the insular Legislature.</p>

<p><i>Education</i>.&mdash;It was not till 1872, when the insular Legislature
passed the Public Elementary Education Act, that the Manx State
undertook any direct responsibility for education. This act differed
from the English Act of 1870 in three important particulars: (1)
it at once constituted every town and parish a school district under a
school board; (2) the attendance of children was made compulsory;
and (3) every elementary school, those in connexion with the Church
of Rome excepted, was obliged to provide for non-sectarian instruction
in religious subjects, and for the reading of the Bible accompanied
by suitable explanation. Since the date of this act education
has made extraordinary strides. It became free in 1892, and a
higher-grade school was established in Douglas in 1894. The
public elementary schools, which are nearly all managed by School
Boards, are subject to the control of a local &ldquo;Council of Education&rdquo;
appointed by the Tynwald Court; but, as the Manx Act of 1872 requires
that, in order to obtain a government grant, the schools
shall fulfil the conditions contained in the minutes of the education
department at Whitehall, they are examined by English inspectors
and compelled to attain the same standard of efficiency as the English
and Welsh schools. In 1907 an act establishing a system of secondary
education was passed by the Legislature. The total number of
public elementary schools in 1906 was 47, 42 being board and 5
denominational. Besides King William&rsquo;s College, opened in 1833,
which provided a similar education to that obtainable at the English
public schools, there are grammar schools in Douglas, Ramsey and
Castletown.</p>

<p>The Manx language (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Celt</a></span>: <i>Language</i>) still lingers, the census
of 1901 showing that there were about 4400 people who understood
something of it. There is now no one who does not speak English.</p>

<p><i>Economics</i>.&mdash;Municipal government was established in 1860, and
in 1876 vaccination was made compulsory, as also was the registration
of births, marriages and deaths in 1878. It was not till 1884
that the sanitation of the towns was seriously taken in hand; but ten
years more elapsed before the sanitary condition of the island was
dealt with by the passing of an act which constituted parish and
village districts, with commissioners elected by the people, who had,
in conjunction with a board elected by the Tynwald Court and an
inspector appointed by it, to attend to all questions relating to sanitation
and infectious diseases. As a result of these measures the
death-rate has been greatly reduced. In 1888 a permissive poor
law was established; it has been adopted by all the towns except
Peel and by seven of the seventeen country parishes. Before this
date the poor had been dependent on voluntary relief, which broke
down owing to the growth of a temporarily employed class occupied
in administering to the wants of the summer visitors. The total
number of persons in receipt of poor relief averages about 920, and
that of lunatics about 212. The average number of births during the
five years 1902-1906 was 21.6, of marriages 6.1, and of deaths 17.6
per thousand. The rateable annual value of the parishes, towns and
villages is about £400,000. The revenue for the year ending the 31st
of March 1907 was £86,365, and the expenditure £75,728. The largest
revenue raised was £91,193 in 1901, and the debt reached its maximum
amount, £219,531, in 1894.</p>

<p><i>History</i>.&mdash;The history of the Isle of Man falls naturally into
three periods. In the first of these the island was inhabited
by a Celtic people. The next is marked by the Viking invasions
and the establishment of Scandinavian rule. The third period
is that of the English dominion. The secular history of the Isle
of Man during the Celtic period is an absolute blank, there
being no trustworthy record of any event whatever before the
incursions of the Northmen, since the exploits attributed to
Baetan MacCairill, king of Ulster, at the end of the 6th century,
which were formally supposed to have been performed in the
Isle of Man, really occurred in the country between the Firths
of Clyde and Forth. And it is clear that, even if the supposed
conquest of the Menavian islands&mdash;Man and Anglesey&mdash;by
Edwin of Northumbria, in 616, did take place, it could not
have led to any permanent results; for, when the English were
driven from the coasts of Cumberland and Lancashire soon
afterwards, they could not well have retained their hold on the
island to the west of these coasts. It is, however, possible that
in 684, when Ecfrid laid Ireland waste from Dublin to Drogheda,
he temporarily occupied Man. During the period of Scandinavian
domination there are two main epochs&mdash;one before the
conquest of Man by Godred Crovan in 1079, and the other after
it. The earlier epoch is characterized by warfare and unsettled
rule, the later is comparatively peaceful. Between about <span class="scs">A.D.</span>
800 and 815 the Vikings came to Man chiefly for plunder;
between about 850 and 990, when they settled in it, the island
fell under the rule of the Scandinavian kings of Dublin; and
between 990 and 1079, it was subject to the powerful earls of
Orkney. The conqueror Godred Crovan was evidently a
remarkable man, though little information about him is attainable.
According to the <i>Chronicon Manniae</i> he &ldquo;subdued
Dublin, and a great part of Leinster, and held the Scots in such
subjection that no one who built a vessel dared to insert more
than three bolts.&rdquo; The memory of such a ruler would be likely
to survive in tradition, and it seems probable therefore that he
is the person commemorated in Manx legend under the name
of King Gorse or Orry. The islands which were under his rule
were called the <i>Suðr-eyjar</i> (Sudreys or the south isles), in contradistinction
to the <i>norðr-eyjar</i>, or the north isles, <i>i.e.</i> the Orkneys
and Shetlands, and they consisted of the Hebrides, and of all
the smaller western islands of Scotland, with Man. At a later
date his successors took the title of <i>Rex Manniae el Insularum</i>.
Olaf, Godred&rsquo;s son, was a powerful monarch, who, according
to the Chronicle, maintained &ldquo;such close alliance with the kings
of Ireland and Scotland that no one ventured to disturb the Isles
during his time&rdquo; (1113-1152). His son, Godred, who for a
short period ruled over Dublin also, as a result of a quarrel with
Somerled, the ruler of Argyll, in 1156, lost the smaller islands
off the coast of Argyll. An independent sovereignty was thus
interposed between the two divisions of his kingdom. Early in
the 13th century, when Reginald of Man did homage to King
John, we hear for the first time of English intervention in the
affairs of Man. But it was into the hands of Scotland that
the islands were ultimately to fall. During the whole of the
Scandinavian period the isles were nominally under the suzerainty
of the kings of Norway, but they only occasionally asserted it
with any vigour. The first to do so was Harold Haarfager
about 885, then came Magnus Barfod about 1100, both of whom
conquered the isles. From the middle of the 12th century till
1217 the suzerainty, owing to the fact that Norway was a prey
to civil dissensions, had been of a very shadowy character. But
after that date it became a reality and Norway consequently
came into collision with the growing power of Scotland. Finally,
in 1261, Alexander III. of Scotland sent envoys to Norway to
negotiate for the cession of the isles, but their efforts led to no
result. He therefore initiated hostilities which terminated in the
complete defeat of the Norwegian fleet at Largs in 1263. Magnus,
king of Man and the Isles, who had fought on the Norwegian
side, was compelled to surrender all the islands over which he
had ruled, except Man, for which he did homage. Two years
later Magnus died and in 1266 the king of Norway, in consideration
of the sum of 4000 marks, ceded the islands, including Man,
to Scotland. But Scotland&rsquo;s rule over Man was not firmly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page538" id="page538"></a>538</span>
established till 1275, when the Manx were defeated in a decisive
battle at Ronaldsway, near Castletown. In 1290 we find
Edward I. of England in possession of Man, and it remained in
English hands till 1313, when it was taken by Robert Bruce
after besieging Castle Rushen for five weeks. Then, till 1346,
when the battle of Neville&rsquo;s Cross decided the long struggle
between England and Scotland in England&rsquo;s favour, there
followed a confused period when Man was sometimes under
English and sometimes under Scottish rule. About 1333
it had been granted by King Edward III. to William de
Montacute, 1st earl of Salisbury, as his absolute possession,
without reserving any service to be rendered to him.
In 1392 his son sold the island &ldquo;with the crowne&rdquo; to
Sir William Le Scroope. In 1399 Henry IV. caused Le Scroope,
who had taken Richard&rsquo;s side, to be beheaded. The island
then came into the possession of the crown and was granted to
Henry de Percy, earl of Northumberland, but, he having been
attainted, Henry IV., in 1406, made a grant of it, with the patronage
of the bishopric, to Sir John Stanley, his heirs and assigns,
on the service of rendering two falcons on paying homage and
two falcons to all future kings of England on their coronation.</p>

<p>With the accession of the Stanleys to the throne there begins
a better epoch in Manx history. Though the island&rsquo;s new rulers
rarely visited its shores, they placed it under responsible
governors, who, in the main, seem to have treated it with justice.
Of the thirteen members of the family who ruled in Man, the
second Sir John Stanley (1414-1432), James, the 7th earl (1627-1651),
and the 10th earl of the same name (1702-1736) had the
most important influence on it. The first curbed the power of
the spiritual barons, introduced trial by jury, instead of trial
by battle, and ordered the laws to be written. The second, known
as the Great Stanley, and his wife, Charlotte de la Tremoille
(or Tremouille), are probably the most striking figures in Manx
history. In 1643 Charles I. ordered him to go to Man, where
the people, who were no doubt influenced by what was taking
place in England, threatened to revolt. But his arrival, with
English soldiers, soon put a stop to anything of this kind. He
conciliated the people by his affability, brought in Englishmen
to teach various handicrafts and tried to help the farmers by
improving the breed of Manx horses, and, at the same time,
he restricted the exactions of the Church. But the Manx
people never had less liberty than under his rule. They were
heavily taxed; troops were quartered upon them; and they also
had the more lasting grievance of being compelled to accept
leases for three lives instead of holding their land by the &ldquo;straw&rdquo;
tenure which they considered to be equivalent to a customary
inheritance. Six months after the death of the king Stanley
received a summons from General Ireton to surrender the island,
which he haughtily declined. In August 1651 he went to
England with some of his troops, among whom were 300 Manxmen,
to join King Charles II., and he and they shared in the
decisive defeat of the Royalists at Worcester. He was captured
and confined in Chester Castle, and, after being tried by court
martial, was executed at Wigan. Soon after his death the
Manx Militia, under the command of William Christian, rose
against the Countess and captured all the insular forts except
Rushen and Peel. They were then joined by a parliamentary
force under Colonel Duckenfield, to whom the Countess surrendered
after a brief resistance. Fairfax had been appointed &ldquo;Lord
of Man and the Isles&rdquo; in September, so that Man continued
under a monarchical government and remained in the same
relation to England as before. The restoration of Stanley
government in 1660 therefore caused as little friction and
alteration as its temporary cessation had. One of the
first acts of the new lord, Charles (the 8th earl), was to order
Christian to be tried. He was found guilty and executed. Of
the other persons implicated in the rebellion only three were
excepted from the general amnesty. But by order in Council
they were pardoned, and the judges responsible for the sentence
on Christian were punished. His next act was to dispute the
permanency of the tenants&rsquo; holdings, which they had not at
first regarded as being affected by the acceptance of leases, a
proceeding which led to an almost open rebellion against his
authority and to the neglect of agriculture. In lieu of it the
people devoted themselves to the fisheries and to contraband
trade. The agrarian question was not settled till 1704, when
James, Charles&rsquo;s brother and successor, largely through the
influence of Bishop Wilson, entered into a compact with his
tenants, which was embodied in an act, called the &ldquo;Act of
Settlement.&rdquo; Their compact secured the tenants in the possession
of their estates in perpetuity on condition of a fixed rent,
and a small fine on succession or alienation. From the great
importance of this act to the Manx people it has been called
their <i>Magna Carta</i>. As time went on, and the value of the estates
increased, the rent payable to the lord became so small in
proportion as to be almost nominal. James died in 1736 and
the sovereignty of the isle passed to James Murray, 2nd duke
of Atholl. In 1764 he was succeeded by his only surviving child
Charlotte, Baroness Strange, and her husband, John Murray,
who, in right of his wife, became Lord of Man. About 1720
the contraband trade greatly increased. In 1726 it was, for a
time, somewhat checked by the interposition of parliament,
but during the last ten years of the Atholl régime (1756-1765)
it assumed such proportions that, in the interests of the imperial
revenue, it became necessary to suppress it. With a view to so
doing an Act of Parliament, called the &ldquo;Revesting Act,&rdquo; was
passed in 1765, under which the sovereign rights of the Atholls
and the customs revenues of the island were purchased for the
sum of £70,000, and an annuity of £2000 was granted to the
duke and duchess. The Atholls still retained their manorial
rights, the patronage of the See, and certain other perquisites,
which were finally purchased for the excessive sum of £417,144
in 1828. Up to the time of the Revestment the Tynwald Court
passed laws concerning the government of the island in all
respects and had control over its finances, subject to the approval
of the lord. After the Revestment, or rather after the passage
of the &ldquo;Mischief Act&rdquo; in the same year, Imperial Parliament
legislated with respect to customs, harbours and merchant
shipping, and, in measures of a general character, it occasionally
inserted clauses by which penalties in contravention of the acts
of which they formed part might be enforced in the island. It
also assumed the control of the insular customs duties. Such
were the changes which, rather than the transference of the
sovereignty from the lord to the king of Great Britain and
Ireland, modified the Constitution of the Isle of Man. Its ancient
laws and tenures were not interfered with, but in many ways the
Revestment adversely affected it. The hereditary lords were far
from being model rulers, but most of them had taken some personal
share in its government, and had interested themselves in
the well-being of its inhabitants. But now the whole direction of
its affairs was handed over to officials, who regarded the island
as a pestilent nest of smugglers, from which it was their duty
to extract as much revenue as possible. Some alleviation of this
state of things was experienced between 1793 and 1826 when
the 4th duke of Atholl was appointed governor, since, though
he quarrelled with the Keys and was unduly solicitous for his
pecuniary interests, he did occasionally exert himself to promote
the welfare of the island. After his departure the English
officials resumed their sway. But they were more considerate
than before. Moreover, since smuggling, which had only been
checked, not suppressed, by the Revesting Act, had by that
time almost disappeared, and the Manx revenue was producing
a large and increasing surplus, the Isle of Man came to be regarded
more favourably, and, thanks to this fact and to the representations
of the Manx people to English ministers in 1837, 1844 and
1853, it obtained a somewhat less stringent customs tariff and an
occasional dole towards erecting its much neglected public works.
Since 1866, when the Isle of Man obtained a measure of at
least nominal &ldquo;Home Rule,&rdquo; the Manx people have made
remarkable progress, and at the present day form a prosperous
community.</p>

<p><i>Monuments.</i>&mdash;The prehistoric monuments in Man are numerous.
There are earth entrenchments, seemingly of the earliest
period; fragments of stone circles and alignments; burial cairns
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page539" id="page539"></a>539</span>
with stone cists of several successive periods; urn mounds
and <i>crannoges</i> or lake dwellings. The monuments belonging to
the historic period begin with the round tower on Peel islet,
the humble Celtic <i>keeills</i> and the sculptured crosses in which
the island is especially rich. Of these crosses about one-fourth
have inscriptions in the old Norse language. The origin and
history of the early buildings remaining on the island are
obscure. The castles of Rushen and Peel are the only important
buildings of a military character which survive, but the remains
of ecclesiastical buildings are numerous and interesting, though,
with the exception of St German&rsquo;s Cathedral on Peel islet,
now in ruins, they are only small and simple structures.</p>

<p><i>Arms.</i>&mdash;There has been much controversy about the origin
of the arms of the island&mdash;the &ldquo;three-legs&rdquo; found on a beautiful
pillar cross near Maughhold churchyard belonging to the latter
part of the 14th century. It was probably originally a sun
symbol and was brought from Sicily by the Vikings. The
motto <i>quocunque jeceris slabit</i> is of comparatively recent origin.</p>

the general post office. Owing to its position on the lake, and
its excellent communications by rail and steamer, Managua
obtained after 1855 an important export trade in coffee, sugar,
cocoa and cotton, although in 1876 it was temporarily ruined

<p><span class="bold">MANAKIN,<a name="ar33" id="ar33"></a></span> from the Dutch word <i>Manneken</i>, applied to
certain small birds, a name apparently introduced into English
by G. Edwards (<i>Nat. Hist. Birds</i>, i. 21) in or about 1743, since
which time it has been accepted generally, and is now used
for those which form the family <i>Pipridae</i>. The manakins
are peculiar to the Neotropical Region and have many of the
habits of the titmouse family (<i>Paridae</i>), living in deep forests,
associating in small bands, and keeping continually in motion,
but feeding almost wholly on the large soft berries of the different
kinds of <i>Melastoma</i>. The <i>Pipridae</i>, however, have no close
affinity with the <i>Paridae</i>,<a name="fa1d" id="fa1d" href="#ft1d"><span class="sp">1</span></a> but belong to another great division
of the order <i>Passeres</i>, the <i>Clamatores</i> group of the <i>Anisomyodae</i>.
The manakins are nearly all birds of gay appearance, generally
exhibiting rich tints of blue, crimson, scarlet, orange or yellow
in combination with chestnut, deep black, black and white,
or olive green; and among their most obvious characteristics
are their short bill and feeble feet, of which the outer toe is
united to the middle toe for a good part of its length. The
tail, in most species very short, has in others the middle
feathers much elongated, and in one of the outer rectrices are
attenuated and produced into threads. They have been divided
(Brit. Mus. <i>Cat. Birds</i>, vol. xiv.) into nineteen genera with
about seventy species, of which eighteen are included under
<i>Pipra</i> itself. <i>P. leucilla</i>, one of the best known, has a wide
distribution from the isthmus of Panama to Guiana and the
valley of the Amazon; but it is one of the most plainly coloured
of the family, being black with a white head. The genus
<i>Machaeropterus</i>, consisting of four species, is very remarkable
for the extraordinary form of some of the secondary wing-feathers
in the males, in which the shaft is thickened and the
webs changed in shape, as described and illustrated by P. L.
Sclater (<i>Proc. Zool. Society</i>, 1860, p. 90; Ibis, 1862, p. 175<a name="fa2d" id="fa2d" href="#ft2d"><span class="sp">2</span></a>)
in the case of the beautiful <i>M. deliciosus</i>, and it has been observed
that the wing-bones of these birds are also much thickened,
no doubt in correlation with this abnormal structure. A like
deviation from the ordinary character is found in the allied
genus <i>Chiromachaeris</i>, comprehending seven species, and Sclater
is of the opinion that it enables them to make the singular
noise for which they have long been noted, described by O. Salvin
(<i>Ibis</i>, 1860, p. 37) in the case of one of them, <i>M. candaei</i>, as
beginning &ldquo;with a sharp note not unlike the crack of a whip,&rdquo;
which is &ldquo;followed by a rattling sound not unlike the call of
a landrail&rdquo;; and it is a similar habit that has obtained for
another species, <i>M. edwardsi</i>, the name in Cayenne, according to
Buffon (<i>Hist. Nat. Oiseaux</i>, iv. 413), of <i>Cassenoisette</i>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MANÁOS,<a name="ar35" id="ar35"></a></span> a city and port of Brazil and capital of the state
of Amazonas, on the left bank of the Rio Negro 12 m. above
its junction with the Solimões, or Amazon, and 908 m. (Wappäus)
above the mouth of the latter, in lat. 3° 8&prime; 4&Prime; S., long. 60° W.
Pop. (1908), about 40,000, including a large percentage of Indians,
negroes and mixed-bloods; the city is growing rapidly. Manáos
stands on a slight eminence overlooking the river, 106 ft. above
sea-level, traversed by several &ldquo;igarapés&rdquo; (canoe paths) or side
channels, and beautified by the luxuriant vegetation of the
Amazon valley. The climate is agreeable and healthful, the
average temperature for the year (1902) being 84°, the number of
rainy days 130, and the total rainfall 66.4 in. Up to the beginning
of the 20th century the only noteworthy public edifices
were the church of N.S. da Conceição, the St Sebastião asylum
and, possibly, a Misericordia hospital; but a government building,
a custom-house, a municipal hall, courts of justice, a marketplace
and a handsome theatre were subsequently erected, and a
modern water-supply system, electric light and electric tramways
were provided. The &ldquo;igarapés&rdquo; are spanned by a number of
bridges. Higher education is provided by a lyceum or high
school, besides which there is a noteworthy school (bearing
the name of Benjamin Constant) for poor orphan girls. Manáos
has a famous botanical garden, an interesting museum, a public
library, and a meteorological observatory. The port of Manáos,
which is the commercial centre of the whole upper Amazon
region, was nothing but a river anchorage before 1902. In that
year a foreign corporation began improvements, which include
a stone river-wall or quay, storehouses for merchandise, and
floating wharves or landing stages connected with the quay by
floating bridges or roadways. The floating wharves and bridges
are made necessary by the rise and fall of the river, the difference
between the maximum and minimum levels being about 33 ft.</p>

<p>The principal exports are rubber, nuts, cacao, dried fish,
hides and piassava fibre. The markets of Manáos receive
their supplies of beef from the national stock ranges on the
Rio Branco, and it is from this region that hides and horns
are received for export. The shipping movement of the port
has become large and important, the total arrivals in 1907,
including small trading boats, being 1589, of which 133 were
ocean-going steamers from Europe and the United States, 75
from south Brazilian ports, and 227 river steamers from Pará.
This rapid growth in its direct trade is due to a provincial law
of 1878 which authorized an abatement of 3% in the export
duties on direct shipments, and a state law of 1900 which made
it compulsory to land and ship all products of the state from
the Manáos custom-house.</p>

<p>The first European settlement on the site of Manáos was
made in 1660, when a small fort was built here by Francisco
da Motta Falcão, and was named São José de Rio Negro. The
mission and village which followed was called Villa de Barra,
or Barra do Rio Negro (the name &ldquo;Barra&rdquo; being derived from
the &ldquo;bar&rdquo; in the current of the river, occasioned by the setback
caused by its encounter with the Amazon). It succeeded
Barcellos as the capital of the old <i>capitania</i> of Rio Negro in
1809, and became the capital of Amazonas when that province
was created in 1850, its name being then changed to Manáos, the
name of the principal tribe of Indians living on the Rio Negro
at the time of its discovery. In 1892 Manáos became the see
of the new bishopric of Amazonas.</p>

the Southern railways. North of the junction is Bull Run,
a small stream which empties into the Occoquan, an arm of the
Potomac. In this neighbourhood two important battles of the
American Civil War, the first and second battles of Bull Run,
were fought on the 21st of July 1861 and on the 29th-30th of
August 1862 respectively; by Southern historians these battles
are called the battles of Manassas. At Manassas is the Manassas
Industrial School for Coloured Youth (non-sectarian; privately

in 1908-1909 it had nine teachers (all negroes) and 121 pupils,

<p><span class="bold">MANASSEH<a name="ar37" id="ar37"></a></span> (7th cent. <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), son of Hezekiah, and king of
Judah (2 Kings xxi. 1-18). His reign of fifty-five years was
marked by a reaction against the reforming policy of his father,
and his persistent idolatry and bloodshed were subsequently
regarded as the cause of the destruction of Jerusalem and of the
dispersion of the people (2 Kings xxiii. 26 seq.; Jer. xv. 4). As
a vassal of Assyria he was contemporary with Sennacherib,
Esar-haddon (681-668 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) and Assur-bani-pal (668-626 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>),
and his name (<i>Me-na-si-e</i>) appears among the tributaries of the
two latter. Little is known of his history. The chronicler,
however, relates that the Assyrian army took him in chains to
Babylon, and that after his repentance he returned, and distinguished
himself by his piety, by building operations in
Jerusalem and by military organization (2 Chron. xxxiii. 10 sqq.).
The story of his penitence referred to in xxxiii. 22, is untrustworthy,
but the historical foundation may have been some
share in the revolt of the Babylonian Samas-sum-ukin (648 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>),
on which occasion he may have been summoned before Assur-bani-pal
with other rebels and subsequently reinstated. See
further Driver, in Hogarth, <i>Authority and Archaeology</i>, pp. 114
sqq. Manasseh was succeeded by his son Amon, who after a
brief reign of two years perished in a conspiracy, his place being
taken by Amon&rsquo;s son (or brother) Josiah (<i>q.v.</i>). A lament formerly
ascribed to Manasseh (cf. 2 Chron. xxxiii. 18) is preserved in the
Apocrypha (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Manasses, Prayer of</a></span>; and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Apocryphal
Literature</a></span>). On Judg. xviii. 30 (marg.), see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Jonathan</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MANASSEH<a name="ar38" id="ar38"></a></span> (apparently Hebrew for &ldquo;he who causes to forget,&rdquo;
but see H. W. Hogg, <i>Encyc. Bib.</i>, <i>s.v.</i>); in the Bible, a
tribe of Israel, the elder but less important of the &ldquo;sons&rdquo; of
Joseph. Its seat lay to the north of Ephraim, but its boundaries
can scarcely be defined. It merged itself with its &ldquo;brother&rdquo;
in the south, and with Issachar, Zebulun and other tribes in
the north (Josh. xvii. 7 sqq.). From the latter it was separated
for a time by a line of Canaanite cities extending from Dor to
Bethshean, which apparently were not all subdued till the days of
David or Solomon (Judg. i. 27; 1 Sam. xxxi. 10; 1 Kings ix. 15).
Besides its western settlement in the fertile glades of northern
Samaria, running out into the great plain, there were territories
east of the Jordan reckoned to Manasseh. Gilead and Bashan
were said to have been taken by Machir, and a number of places
of uncertain identification were occupied by Nobah and Jair
(Num. xxxii. 41; Judg. x. 3-5). It seems most natural to suppose
that these districts were held before the Israelites crossed over
to the west (cf. the tradition Num. xxi., Deut. iii.). On the
other hand, in Judg. v. 14, Machir may conceivably belong to
the west, and it is possible that, according to another tradition,
these movements were the result of the complaint of the Joseph
tribes that their original territory was too restricted.<a name="fa1e" id="fa1e" href="#ft1e"><span class="sp">1</span></a> In the
genealogical lists, Machir, perhaps originally an independent
branch, is the eldest son of Manasseh (Josh. xvii. 1 <i>b</i>, 2); but
according to later schemes he is Manasseh&rsquo;s only son (Num.
xxvi. 28-34). Intermixture with Arameans is indicated in the
view that he was the son of Manasseh and an Aramean concubine
(1 Chron. vii. 14), and this is supported by the statement that
the Arameans of Geshur and Maacah (cf. 2 Sam. x. 6; Gen. xxii.
24) dwelt among the Israelites of eastern Jordan (Josh. xiii. 13).
Subsequently, at an unknown period of history, sixty cities
were lost (1 Chron. ii. 23). The story of the daughters of the
Manassite Zelophehad is of interest for the Hebrew law of
inheritance (Num. xxvii. 1-11, xxxvi.).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page541" id="page541"></a>541</span></p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Some details of the history of this twofold branch of the Israelites
are contained in the stories of Gideon (W. Manasseh) and Jephthah
(E. Manasseh). The relations between Saul and Jabesh-Gilead
point to the close bond uniting the two districts, but the details have
been variously interpreted: Winckler, for example, suggesting that
Saul himself was originally from E. Manasseh and that he followed
in the steps of Jephthah (<i>Keilinschr. u. d. alte Test.</i>, pp. 216 seq. 227).
Generally speaking, its position in the west made it share the
fortunes of Ephraim, whilst on the east the proximity of Ammonites
and Moabites controlled its history; see also the articles on its

synopsis of events from the creation of the world to the end of the
reign of Nicephorus Botaniates (1081), written by direction of
Irene, the emperor&rsquo;s sister-in-law. It consists of about 7000 lines

it, except that it is rather more poetical than the iambic chronicle
of Ephraim (about 150 years later). It obtained great popularity
and appeared in a free prose translation; it was also translated
into Slavonic. The poetical romance of the <i>Loves of

<p><a name="ft1f" id="ft1f" href="#fa1f"><span class="fn">1</span></a> &ldquo;Political&rdquo; verse or metre is the name given to a kind of verse
found as early as the 6th century in proverbs, and characteristic
of Byzantine and modern Greek poetry. It takes no account of the
quantity of syllables; the scansion depends on accent, and there is
always an accent on the last syllable but one. It is specially used
of an iambic verse with fifteen syllables, <i>i.e.</i> seven feet and an unaccented
syllable over. Byron compares &ldquo;A captain bold of
Halifax who lived in country quarters.&rdquo; Such facile metres are
called &ldquo;political,&rdquo; in the sense of &ldquo;commonplace,&rdquo; &ldquo;of the city.&rdquo;
Cf. Gibbon&rsquo;s <i>Decline and Fall</i> (ed. Bury, 1898), vi. 108; Du Cange,
<i>Gloss. med. et infin. lat.</i> (vi. 395), who has an interesting quotation

<p><span class="bold">MANASSES, PRAYER OF,<a name="ar40" id="ar40"></a></span> an apocryphal book of the Old
Testament. This writing, which since the Council of Trent
has been relegated by the Church of Rome to the position
of an appendix to the Vulgate, was placed by Luther and the
translators of the English Bible among the apocryphal books.
In some MSS. of the Septuagint it is the eighth among the
canticles appended to the Psalter, though in many Greek
psalters, which include the canticles, it is not found at all. In
Swete&rsquo;s Old Testament in Greek, iii. 802 sqq., A is printed with
the variants of T (<i>Psalterium turicense</i>).<a name="fa1g" id="fa1g" href="#ft1g"><span class="sp">1</span></a> From the statements
in 2 Chron. xxxiii. 12, 13, 18, 19, it follows that the Old Testament
chronicler found a prayer attributed to Manasseh in his Hebrew
sources, <i>The History of the Kings of Israel</i> and <i>The History of the
Seers</i>. Naturally the question arose, had the existing Prayer of
Manasses any direct connexion with the prayer referred to by the
chronicler? Ewald was of opinion that the Greek was an
actual translation of the lost Hebrew; but Ball more wisely takes
it as a free rendering of a lost Haggadic narrative founded on the
older document from which the chronicler drew his information.
This view he supports by showing that there was once a considerable
literature in circulation regarding Manasseh&rsquo;s later
history. On the other hand most scholars take the Prayer to
have been written in Greek, <i>e.g.</i> Fritzsche, Schürer and Ryssel
(Kautzsch, <i>Apok. u. Pseud.</i> i. 165-168).</p>

<p>This fine penitential prayer seems to have been modelled after
the penitential psalms. It exhibits considerable unity of thought,
and the style is, in the main, dignified and simple.</p>

<p>As regards the date, Fritzsche, Ball and Ryssel agree in
assigning this psalm to the Maccabean period. Its eschatology
and doctrine of &ldquo;divine forgiveness&rdquo; may point to an earlier
date.</p>

<div class="condensed">

<p><span class="bold">MANATI<a name="ar41" id="ar41"></a></span> (often anglicized as &ldquo;manatee&rdquo;), the name, adapted
from the Carib <i>manattouï</i>, given by the Spanish colonists of the
West Indies to the American representative of a small group of
herbivorous aquatic mammals, constituting, with their allies
the dugong and the now extinct <i>Rhytina</i>, the order Sirenia.
The name, though possibly of Mandingo origin (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Mandingo</a></span>),
was latinized as <i>manatus</i>, furnished with hands, thus referring
the etymology to the somewhat hand-like form, or hand-like use,
of the fore-flippers, which alone serve these creatures for limbs.
Manatis, as shown in the illustration in the article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Sirenia</a></span>, are
somewhat whale-like in shape, having a similar horizontally
expanded tail-fin; but here the resemblance to the Cetacea ceases,
the whole organization of these animals being constructed on
entirely different lines. The American manati, <i>Manatus</i> (or,
as some would have it, <i>Trichechus latirostris</i>), inhabits the rivers
of Florida, Mexico, Central America and the West Indies, and
measures from 9 to 13 feet in length. The body is somewhat fish-like,
but depressed and ending posteriorly in a broad, flat, shovel-like
horizontal tail, with rounded edges. The head is of moderate
size, oblong, with a blunt, truncated muzzle, and divided from
the body by a slight constriction or neck. The fore limbs are
flattened oval paddles, placed rather low on the sides of the body,
and showing externally no signs of division into fingers, but with
three diminutive flat nails near their extremities. No traces of
hind limbs are discernible either externally or internally; and
there is no dorsal fin. The mouth is peculiar, the tumid upper
lip being cleft in the middle line into two lobes, each of which is
separately movable. The nostrils are two semilunar valve-like
slits at the apex of the muzzle. The eyes are very minute, placed
at the sides of the head, and with a nearly circular aperture with
wrinkled margins; and external ears are wanting. The skin
generally is of a dark greyish colour, not smooth or glistening
like that of whale or dolphin, but finely wrinkled. At a little
distance it appears naked, but close inspection, at all events
in young animals, shows a scanty covering of delicate hairs,
and both upper and under lips are supplied with short, stiff
bristles.</p>

<tr><td class="caption">Front view of head of American Manati, showing the eyes, nostrils,
and mouth. A, with the lobes of the upper lip divaricated; B, with
the lip contracted.</td></tr></table>

<p>Manatis have a number&mdash;as many as 20 pairs in each jaw&mdash;of
two-ridged teeth, of which, however, but comparatively few are
in use at once. They lack the large tusks of the male dugong,
and the fore part of the skull is not so much bent down as in that
animal. In life the palate has a horny plate, with a similar one
in the lower jaw. The skeleton is described under <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Sirenia</a></span>.</p>

<p>Manatis pass their life in the water, inhabiting bays, lagoons,
estuaries and large rivers, but the open sea is unsuited to their
peculiar mode of life. As a rule they prefer shallow water, in
which, when not feeding, they lie near the bottom. In deeper
water they often float, with the body much arched, the rounded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page542" id="page542"></a>542</span>
back close to the surface, and the head, limbs and tail hanging
downwards. The air in the lungs assists them to maintain this
position. Their food consists exclusively of aquatic plants, on
which they feed beneath the water. They are slow in their
movements, and perfectly harmless, but are subject to persecution
for the sake of their oil, skin and flesh. Frequent attempts
have been made to keep specimens alive in captivity, and sometimes
with considerable success, one having lived in the Brighton
Aquarium for upwards of sixteen months. From such captive
specimens certain observations on the mode of life of these
animals have been made. We learn, for instance, that from the
shoulder-joint the flippers can be moved in all directions, and the
elbow and wrist permit of free extension and flexion. In feeding,
manatis push the food towards their mouths by means of one of
the hands, or both used simultaneously, and any one who has
seen these members thus employed can believe the stories of their
carrying their young under their arms. Still more interesting
is the action of the peculiar lateral pads formed by the divided
upper lip, thus described by Professor A. Garrod: &ldquo;These pads
have the power of transversely approaching towards and receding
from one another simultaneously (see fig.). When the animal
is on the point of seizing (say) a leaf of lettuce, the pads are
diverged transversely in such a way as to make a median gap
of considerable breadth. Directly the leaf is within grasp the
lip-pads are approximated, the leaf is firmly seized between their
contiguous bristly surfaces, and then drawn inwards by a backward
movement of the lower margin of the lip as a whole.&rdquo; The
animal is thus enabled by the unaided means of the upper lip
to introduce food placed before it without the assistance of the
comparatively insignificant lower lip, the action recalling that of
the mouth of the silkworm and other caterpillars in which the
mandibles diverge and converge laterally during mastication.
All trustworthy observations indicate that the manati has not
the power of voluntarily leaving the water. None of the specimens
in confinement has been observed to emit any sound.</p>

<p>The Amazonian manati (<i>M. inunguis</i>) is a much smaller
species, not exceeding 7 or 8 ft. in length, and without nails to
the flippers. It ascends most of the tributaries of the Amazon
until stopped by rapids. From a specimen which lived a short
time in London it appears that the lip-pads are less developed
than in the northern species. The third species is the West
African <i>M. senegalensis</i>, which extends a distance of about ten
degrees south and sixteen north of the equator, and ranges into
the heart of the continent as far as Lake Tchad. From 8 to 10 ft.
appears to be the normal length; the weight of a specimen was
590 &#8468;. The colour is bluish black, with a tinge of olive-green
above and yellow below.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MANBHUM,<a name="ar42" id="ar42"></a></span> a district of British India, in the Chota Nagpur
division of Bengal. The administrative headquarters are at
Purulia. Area, 4147 sq. m.; pop. (1901), 1,301,364, showing
an increase of 9.1% since 1891. Manbhum district forms the
first step of a gradual descent from the table-land of Chota
Nagpur to the delta of lower Bengal. In the northern and
eastern portions the country is open, and consists of a series of
rolling downs dotted here and there with isolated conical hills.
In the western and southern tracts the country is more broken
and the scenery much more picturesque. The principal hills
are Dalma (3407 ft.), the crowning peak of a range of the same
name; Gangabari or Gajboro (2220 ft.), the highest peak of the
Baghmundi range, about 20 m. south-west of Purulia; and
Panchkot or Panchet (1600 ft.), on which stands the old fort
of the rajas of Panchet. The hills are covered with dense
jungle. The chief river is the Kasai, which flows through the
district from north-west to south-east into Midnapore, and on
which a considerable floating trade in <i>sal</i> timber is carried on.
The most numerous aboriginal tribe are the Sontals; but the
Bhumij Kols are the characteristic race. In Manbhum they
inhabit the country lying on both sides of the Subanrekha.
They are pure Mundas, but their compatriots to the east have
dropped the title of Munda and the use of their distinctive
language, have adopted Hindu customs, and are fast becoming
Hindus in religion. The Bhumij Kols of the Jungle Mahals
were once the terror of the surrounding districts; they are now
more peaceful.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Three principal crops of rice are grown, one sown broadcast early
in May on table-lands and the tops of ridges, an autumn crop, and
a winter crop, the last forming the chief harvest of the district.
Other crops are wheat, barley, Indian corn, pulses, oilseeds, linseeds,
jute, hemp, sugar-cane, indigo, pan and tobacco. Owing to the
completeness of the natural drainage, floods are unknown, but the
country is liable to droughts caused by deficient rainfall. The
principal articles of export are oilseeds, pulses, <i>ghi</i>, lac, indigo, tussur
silk (manufactured near Raghunathpur), timber, resin, coal, and (in
good seasons) rice. The chief imports are salt, piece goods, brass
utensils and unwrought iron. Cotton hand-loom weaving is carried
on all over the district. Manbhum contains the Jherria coalfield, in
the Damodar valley, where a large number of mines have been opened
since 1894. The United Free Church of Scotland has a mission
at Pakheria, with a printing press that issues a monthly journal
in Sonthali; and a German Lutheran mission has been established
since 1864. The district is traversed by the Bengal-Nagpur railway,
while two branches of the East Indian railway serve the coalfield.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MANCHA, LA<a name="ar43" id="ar43"></a></span> (Arabic, <i>Al Mansha</i>, &ldquo;the dry land&rdquo; or &ldquo;wilderness&rdquo;),
a name which when employed in its widest sense denotes
the bare and monotonous elevated plateau of central Spain that
stretches between the mountains of Toledo and the western
spurs of the hills of Cuenca, being bounded on the S. by the
Sierra Morena and on the N. by the Alcarria region. It thus
comprises portions of the modern provinces of Toledo, Albacete
and Cuenca, and the greater part of Ciudad Real. Down to the
16th century the eastern portion was known as La Mancha de
Montearagon or de Aragon, and the western simply as La
Mancha; afterwards the north-eastern and south-western sections
respectively were distinguished by the epithets <i>Alta</i> and <i>Baja</i>
(upper and lower). La Mancha is famous as the scene of Cervantes&rsquo;
novel <i>Don Quixote</i>; in appearance, with its multitude of
windmills and vast tracts of arid land, it remains almost exactly
as Cervantes described it. Many villages, such as El Toboso
and Argamasilla de Alba, both near Alcázar de San Juan, are
connected by tradition with episodes in <i>Don Quixote</i>.</p>


<div class="center ptb6"><img style="width:200px; height:36px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img000.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p><span class="bold">MANCHE,<a name="ar44" id="ar44"></a></span> a department of north-western France, made up
chiefly of the Cotentin and the Avranchin districts of Normandy,
and bounded W., N. and N.E. by the English Channel (Fr.
<i>La Manche</i>), from which it derives its name, E. by the department
of Calvados, S.E. by Orne, S. by Mayenne and Ille-et-Vilaine.
Pop. (1906), 487,443. Area, 2475 sq. m.</p>

<p>The department is traversed from south to north by a range
of hills, in many parts picturesque, and connected in the south
with those of Maine and Brittany. In the country round Mortain,
which has been called the Switzerland of Normandy, they rise
to a height of 1200 ft. The coast-line, running northward along
the bay of the Seine from the rocks of Grand Camp to Cape
Barfleur, thence westward to Cape la Hague, and finally southward
to the Bay of Mont St Michel, has a length of 200 miles.
The Vire and the Taute (which near the small port of Carentan
receives the Ouve as a tributary on the left) fall into the sea at the
Calvados border, and are united by a canal some miles above their
mouths. From the mouth of the Taute a low beach runs to the
port of St Vaast-la-Hougue, where the coast becomes rocky, with
sandbanks. Off St Vaast lies the fortified island of Tatihow,
with the laboratory of marine zoology of the Natural History
Museum of Paris. Between Cape Barfleur and Cape la Hague
lie the roads of Cherbourg, protected by the famous breakwater.
The whole western coast is inhospitable; its small havens, lying
behind formidable barriers and reefs, are almost dry at low tide.
Great cliffs, such as the points of Jobourg (420 ft. high) and
Flamanville, alternate with long strands, such as that which
extends for 30 m. from Cape Carteret to Granville. Between
this coast and the Channel Islands the tide, pent up between
numerous sandbanks, flows with a terrific force that has given
these passages such ill-omened names as <i>Passage de la Déroute</i>
and the like. The only important harbours are Granville and
the haven of refuge of Diélette between Granville and Cherbourg.
Carteret carries on a passenger traffic with the Channel Islands.
The chief stream is the Sienne, with its tributary the Soulle
flowing by Coutances. South of Granville the <span class="correction" title="amended from samds">sands</span> of St Pair
are the commencement of the great bay of Mont Saint Michel,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page543" id="page543"></a>543</span>
whose area of 60,000 acres was covered with forest till the terrible
tide of the year 709. The equinoctial tides reach a vertical
height of nearly 50 ft. In the bay the picturesque walls of the
abbey rise from the summit of a rock 400 ft. high. The Sée,
which waters Avranches, and the Couesnon (separating Manche
from Ille-et-Vilaine) disembogue in the bay.</p>

<p>The climate of Manche is mild and humid, from its propinquity
to the sea. Frosts are never severe; myrtles and fuchsias flourish
in the open air. Excessive heat is also unusual; the predominant
winds are south-west.</p>

<p>The characteristic industry of the department is the rearing
of horses and cattle, carried on especially in the rich meadow of
the eastern Cotentin; sheep are raised in the western arrondissement
of Coutances. Wheat, buckwheat, barley and oats
are the chief cereals cultivated. Manche is one of the foremost
departments for the production of cider-apples and pears; plums
and figs are also largely grown. Butter is an important source
of profit, as also are poultry and eggs. Flourishing market-gardens
are found in the west. The department contains
valuable granite quarries in the Cherbourg arrondissement and
the Chausey islands; building and other stone is quarried.</p>

<p>Villedieu manufactures copper-ware and Sourdeval iron and
other metal-ware; and there are wool-spinning mills, paper-works
and leather-works, but the department as a whole is industrially
unimportant. There are oyster-beds on the coast (St Vaast, &amp;c.),
and the maritime population, besides fishing for herring, mackerel,
lobsters or sole, collect seaweed for agricultural use. Coutances
is the seat of a bishopric of the province of Rouen. The department
forms part of the region of the X. army corps and of the
circumscriptions of the académie (educational division) and
appeal-court of Caen. Cherbourg (<i>q.v.</i>), with its important port,
arsenal and shipbuilding yards, is the chief centre of population.
St Lô (<i>q.v.</i>) is the capital; there are six arrondissements (St Lô,
Avranches, Cherbourg, Coutances, Mortain, Valognes), with 48
cantons and 647 communes. Avranches, Mortain, Coutances,
Granville and Mont Saint Michel receive separate treatment.
At Lessay and St Sauveur-le-Vicomte there are the remains of
ancient Benedictine abbeys, and Torigni-sur-Vire and Tourlaville
(close to Cherbourg) have interesting châteaux of the 16th century.
Valognes, which in the 17th and 18th centuries posed as a
provincial centre of culture, has a church (15th, 16th and 17th
centuries) remarkable for its dome, the only one of Gothic architecture
in France.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MANCHESTER, EARLS AND DUKES OF.<a name="ar45" id="ar45"></a></span> The Manchester
title, in the English peerage, belongs to a branch of the family of
Montagu (<i>q.v.</i>). The first earl was <span class="sc">Sir Henry Montagu</span> (<i>c.</i>
1563-1642), grandson of Sir Edward Montagu, chief justice of the
king&rsquo;s bench 1539-1545, who was named by King Henry VIII.
one of the executors of his will, and governor to his son, Edward
VI. Sir Henry Montagu, who was born at Boughton, Northamptonshire,
about 1563, was educated at Christ&rsquo;s College,
Cambridge, and, having been called to the bar, was elected recorder
of London in 1603, and in 1616 was made chief justice of the
king&rsquo;s bench, in which office it fell to him to pass sentence on
Sir Walter Raleigh in October 1618. In 1620 he was appointed
lord high treasurer, being raised to the peerage as Baron Montagu
of Kimbolton, Huntingdonshire, and Viscount Mandeville. He
became president of the council in 1621, in which office he was
continued by Charles I., who created him earl of Manchester<a name="fa1h" id="fa1h" href="#ft1h"><span class="sp">1</span></a> in
1626. In 1628 he became lord privy seal, and in 1635 a commissioner
of the treasury. Although from the beginning of his
public life in 1601, when he first entered parliament, Manchester
had inclined to the popular side in politics, he managed to retain
to the end the favour of the king. He was a judge of the Star
Chamber, and one of the most trusted councillors of Charles I.
His loyalty, ability and honesty were warmly praised by Clarendon.
In conjunction with Coventry, the lord keeper, he pronounced
an opinion in favour of the legality of ship-money in
1634. He died on the 7th of November 1642. Manchester was
married three times. One of his sons by his third wife was father
of Charles Montagu, created earl of Halifax in 1699.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Edward Montagu</span>, 2nd earl of Manchester (1602-1671), eldest
son of the 1st earl by his first wife, Catherine Spencer, granddaughter
of Sir John Spencer of Althorpe, was born in 1602, and
was educated at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge. He was
member of parliament for Huntingdonshire 1623-1626, and in
the latter year was raised to the peerage in his father&rsquo;s lifetime as
Baron Montagu of Kimbolton, but was known generally by his
courtesy title of Viscount Mandeville. His first wife, who was
related to the duke of Buckingham, having died in 1625 after two
years of marriage, Mandeville married in 1626 Anne, daughter
of the 2nd earl of Warwick. The influence of his father-in-law,
who was afterwards admiral on the side of the parliament, drew
Mandeville to the popular side in the questions in dispute with
the crown, and at the beginning of the Long Parliament he was
one of the recognized leaders of the popular party in the upper
House, his name being joined with those of the five members of
the House of Commons impeached by the king in 1642. At the
outbreak of the Civil War, having succeeded his father in the
earldom in November 1642, Manchester commanded a regiment
in the army of the earl of Essex, and in August 1643 he was
appointed major-general of the parliamentary forces in the eastern
counties, with Cromwell as his second in command. Having
become a member of the &ldquo;committee of both kingdoms&rdquo; in
1644, he was in supreme command at Marston Moor (July 1,
1644); but in the subsequent operations his lack of energy brought
him into disagreement with Cromwell, and in November 1644 he
strongly expressed his disapproval of continuing the war (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Cromwell, Oliver</a></span>). Cromwell brought the shortcomings of
Manchester before parliament in the autumn of 1644; and early
in the following year, anticipating the self-denying ordinance,
Manchester resigned his command. He took a leading part in the
frequent negotiations for an arrangement with Charles, was custodian
with Lenthall of the great seal 1646-1648, and frequently
presided in the House of Lords. He opposed the trial of the king,
and retired from public life during the Commonwealth; but after
the Restoration, which he actively assisted, he was loaded with
honours by Charles II. In 1667 he was made a general, and he died
on the 5th of May 1671. Manchester was made a K.G. in 1661,
and became F.R.S. in 1667. Men of such divergent sympathies
as Baxter, Burnet and Clarendon agreed in describing Manchester
as a lovable and virtuous man, who loved peace and moderation
both in politics and religion. He was five times married, leaving
children by two of his wives, and was succeeded in the title by his
eldest son, Robert, 3rd earl of Manchester (1634-1683).</p>

son of Robert, 3rd earl of Manchester, was educated at Trinity
College, Cambridge, and succeeded to his father&rsquo;s earldom in 1683.
Warmly sympathizing with the Whig revolution of 1688, he
attended William and Mary at their coronation, fought under
William at the Boyne, became a privy councillor in 1698, and
held various important diplomatic posts between that date and
1714, when he received an appointment in the household of
George I., by whom on the 28th of April 1719 he was created
duke of Manchester. He died on the 20th of January 1722, and
was succeeded successively in the dukedom by his two sons,
William 2nd duke of Manchester (1700-1739), and Robert 3rd
duke (<i>c.</i> 1710-1762), who was vice-chamberlain to Queen Caroline,
wife of George II.</p>

<p><span class="sc">George Montagu</span>, 4th duke of Manchester (1737-1788), was
the son of Robert, the 3rd duke. He was a supporter of Lord
Rockingham, and an active opponent in the House of Lords of
Lord North&rsquo;s American policy. In the Rockingham ministry
of 1782 Manchester became lord chamberlain. He died in
September 1788.</p>

second son of the preceding, was educated at Harrow, and having
become a colonel in the army in 1794, was appointed governor
of Jamaica in 1808. Here he remained, except for a visit to
England (1811-1813) till 1827, administering the colony with
ability in a period of considerable difficulty, and doing much to
prepare the way for emancipation of the slaves. From 1827 to
1830 he was postmaster-general in the cabinet of the duke of
Wellington, and died in Rome on the 18th of March 1843. His
wife was Susan, daughter of the 4th duke of Gordon. He was succeeded
by his son George, 6th duke (1799-1855), a captain in the
navy; whose son William Drogo, 7th duke (1823-1890), married
Louise, daughter of the Comte d&rsquo;Alten of Hanover, who after
his death married Spencer Cavendish, 8th duke of Devonshire.
William was succeeded by his son George Victor Drogo, 8th duke
of Manchester (1853-1892), on whose death the title devolved
on his son, William Angus Drogo, 9th duke of Manchester

<p><span class="bold">MANCHESTER,<a name="ar46" id="ar46"></a></span> a township of Hartford county, Connecticut,
U.S.A., about 9 m. E. of Hartford. Pop.(1890), 8222; (1900),
10,601, of whom 3771 were foreign-born; (1910 census)
13,641. Manchester is served by the New York, New Haven
&amp; Hartford railway and by electric line connecting with
Hartford, Rockville and Stafford Springs. The township
covers an area of about 28 sq. m., and includes the villages of
Manchester, South Manchester, Buckland, Manchester Green
and Highland Park. The Hockanum River provides a good
water power, and Manchester has various manufactures. At
South Manchester, an attractive industrial village, a silk mill was
built in 1838; the silk mills of one firm (Cheney Brothers) here
cover about 12 acres; the company has done much for its employees,
whose homes are almost all detached cottages in attractive
grounds. Manchester was originally a part of the township
of Hartford, and later a part of the township of East Hartford.
The first settlement within its present limits was made about
1672; the land was bought from the Indians in 1676; and the
township was separated from East Hartford and incorporated in
1823.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MANCHESTER,<a name="ar47" id="ar47"></a></span> a city and county of a city, municipal,
county and parliamentary borough of Lancashire, England,
189 m. N.W. by N. of London, and 31 m. E. by N. of Liverpool.
It stands for the most part on a level plain, the rising ground
being chiefly on the north side. The rivers are the Irwell, the
Medlock, the Irk, and the Tib, the last entirely overarched
and covered by streets and warehouses. The Irwell, which
separates Manchester from Salford, is crossed by a series of
bridges and discharges itself into the Mersey, which is about
10 m. distant. The chief part of the district, before it was
covered with the superficial drift of sand, gravel and clay,
consisted of upper New Red Sandstone with slight portions
of lower New Red Sandstone, magnesian marls and upper
red marls, hard sandstone and limestone rock, and cold clays
and shales of contiguous coal-fields. The city, as its thousands
of brick-built houses show, has been for the most part dug
out of its own clay-fields. The parliamentary and municipal
boroughs of Manchester are not conterminous. The city
boundaries, which in 1841 enclosed 4293 acres, have been
successively enlarged and now enclose 19,914 acres.</p>

<p>There are four large stations for the Lancashire &amp; Yorkshire,
London &amp; North-Western, the Midland, Cheshire lines, Great
Northern, and Great Central railways, and many subsidiary
stations for local traffic. Tramways, as well as railways,
run from Manchester to Oldham, Ashton, Eccles, Stockport,
&amp;c., with which places the city is connected by continuous
lines of street. The length of the streets in the city of Manchester
is 758 m. (exclusive of those in the district of Withington,
which joined the city in 1905). The tramway lines within
the city boundaries extend to 111 m., and in addition there
are 58 m. leased to the corporation by adjacent local authorities.
As a matter of fact, the whole of south-east Lancashire
and some portions of Cheshire are linked to Manchester by
railways and tramways so as to form one great urban area,
and the traveller passes from one town to another by lines of
street which, for the most part, are continuous. Facility of
communication is essential to the commercial prosperity of
Manchester, and its need was recognized by the duke of Bridgewater,
whose canal, constructed in 1761, has now been absorbed
by the Manchester Ship Canal (<i>q.v.</i>). The making of this
early waterway was an event only less important than the
opening of the Manchester &amp; Liverpool railway in 1830.</p>

<p>The township of Manchester, which forms the nucleus of the
city, is comparatively small, and outlying hamlets having
been added, its size has increased without regularity of plan.
Roughly speaking, the city forms a square, with Market Street
as its central thoroughfare. The tendency of recent development
is to reduce the irregularities so that the other main
streets may either run parallel to or intersect Market Street.
Deansgate, which formerly ended in a narrow tangle of
buildings, is now a broad road with many handsome buildings,
and the same process of widening, enlarging and rebuilding
is going on, more or less, all over Manchester. Market Street,
which has not been widened since 1820, has been termed, and
with some reason, &ldquo;the most congested street in Europe&rdquo;;
but relief is anticipated from some of the other street improvements.
The centre of the city is occupied by business premises;
the factories and workshops are mainly on the eastern side.
The most important of the public buildings are in the centre
and the south. The latter is also the most favoured residential
district, and at its extremity is semi-rural in character. Large
masses of the population live beyond the city boundary and
come to their daily avocations by train and tram. Such a
population is rarely homogeneous and Manchester attracts
citizens from every part of the globe; there are considerable
numbers of German, Armenian and Jewish residents. The
houses are for the most part of brick, the public buildings
of stone, which is speedily blackened by the smoky atmosphere.
Many of the warehouses are of considerable architectural merit,
and in recent years the use of terra-cotta has become more
common. It is only in the suburbs that gardens are possible;
the air is laden with black dust, and the rivers, in spite of all
efforts, are in the central part of the city mere dirty ditches.
It is impossible to describe Manchester in general terms, for
within the city boundaries the conditions vary from the most
squalid of slums to suburban and almost rural beauty.</p>

<p><i>Churches.</i>&mdash;Manchester is the seat of an Anglican bishopric,
and the chief ecclesiastical building is the cathedral, which,
however, was built simply as a parish church, and, although a
fine specimen of the Perpendicular period, is by no means
what might be expected as the cathedral of an important and
wealthy diocese. In the course of restoration a piece of Saxon
sculpture came to light. This &ldquo;Angel stone&rdquo; represents
a winged figure with a scroll inscribed <i>In manus tuas Domine</i>
in characters of the 8th century. The bulk of the building
belongs to the early part of the 15th century. The first warden
was John Huntington, rector of Ashton, who built the choir.
The building, which was noticed for its hard stone by Leland
when he visited the town, did not stand time and weather well,
and by 1845 some portions of it were rapidly decaying. This
led to its restoration by James P. Holden. By 1868 the tower
was almost completely renovated in a more durable stone.
Further restoration was carried out by J. S. Crowther, and
the addition of a porch and vestries was executed by Basil
Champneys. The total length is 220 ft. and the breadth 112 ft.
There are several stained-glass windows, including one to the
memory of &ldquo;Chinese Gordon.&rdquo; The recumbent statues of
Bishop James Fraser and of Hugh Birley, M.P., should also
be named. In the Ely chapel is the altar tomb of Bishop
James Stanley. In the stalls there are some curious <i>miserere</i>
carvings. The tower is 139 ft. high, and contains a peal of
ten bells, chiefly from the foundry of the Rudhalls. There
are two organs, one by Father Smith, and a modern one in an
oak case designed by Sir G. Scott. The parish church was
made collegiate in 1422, and when in 1847 the bishopric of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page545" id="page545"></a>545</span>
Manchester was created the warden and fellows became dean
and canons and the parish church became the cathedral. The
first bishop was James Prince Lee, who died in 1869; the second
was James Fraser, who died in 1885; the third was James
Moorhouse, who resigned in 1903 and was succeeded by Edmund
Arbuthnott Knox. The church endowments are considerable
and have been the subject of a special act of parliament, known
as the Manchester Rectory Division Act of 1845, which provides
£1500 per annum for the dean and £600 to each of the four
canons, and divides the residue among the incumbents of the
new churches formed out of the old parish.</p>

<div class="center ptb2"><img style="width:1078px; height:917px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img545.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Of the Roman Catholic churches that of the Holy Name,
which belongs to the Jesuits, is remarkable for its costly decoration.
The Greek Church and most of the Nonconformist
bodies have places of worship. There are twelve Jewish
synagogues. The meeting-house of the Society of Friends
is said to be the largest of the kind in the kingdom and will
seat 1200 persons.</p>

<p><i>Public Buildings.</i>&mdash;The Royal Infirmary, founded in 1752,
having become inadequate for its purposes, a new building has
been erected on the south side of the city near the university,
from designs by Edwin T. Hall and John Brooke; it was opened
in 1909 by king Edward VII. The central site in Piccadilly thus
became available for other purposes, and the corporation gave
instructions for plans to be made for a new library and art
gallery. The art gallery already existing in 1909 was founded as
the Royal Institution, but in 1882 passed under the control of
the city council. The building was designed by Sir Charles
Barry. The collection contains some fine paintings by Etty,
Millais, Leighton and other artists. The sculpture includes
casts of the Elgin marbles and a statue of Dr John Dalton
by Chantrey. The most striking of the public buildings is
the town hall, probably the largest municipal building in the
country, but no longer entirely adequate to the increasing
business of the city council. It was completed in 1877 from
designs by Alfred Waterhouse, who selected as the style of
architecture a form of Gothic, but treated it very freely as
purposes of utility required. The edifice covers 8000 sq. yds.,
and includes more than two hundred and fifty rooms. The
building consists of continuous lines of corridors surrounding a
central courtyard and connected by bridges. The principal
tower is 286 ft. high to the top of the ball, and affords a view
which extends over a large part of south Lancashire and Cheshire
and is bounded only by the hills of Derbyshire. The tower
contains a remarkable peal of bells by Taylor of Loughborough,
forming an almost perfect chromatic scale of twenty-one bells;
each bell has on it a line from canto 105 of Tennyson&rsquo;s <i>In
Memoriam</i>. The great hall is 100 ft. long and 50 ft. wide,
and contains a magnificent organ built by Cavaillé-Coll of
Paris. The twelve panels of this room are filled with paintings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page546" id="page546"></a>546</span>
by Ford Madox Brown, illustrating the history and progress
of the city. The royal exchange is a fine specimen of Italian
architecture and was erected in 1869; the great meeting-hall
is one of the largest rooms in England, the ceiling having a
clear area, without supports, of 120 ft. in width. The exchange
is seen at its best on market days (Tuesday and Friday). The
assize courts were built in 1864 from designs by Waterhouse.
The style is a mixture of Early English and Decorative, and
a large amount of decorative art has been expended on the
building. The branch Bank of England is a Doric building
designed by C. R. Cockerell. There are separate town-halls
for the townships of Ardwick, Chorlton, Hulme, Cheetham,
Broughton and Pendleton. The Free Trade hall is a fine
structure in the Lombardo-Venetian style, and its great hall
will accommodate about five thousand people. It is used
for public meetings, concerts, &amp;c., and was built by Edward
Walters. The Athenaeum, designed by Barry, was founded
by Richard Cobden and others associated with him for &ldquo;the
advancement and diffusion of knowledge.&rdquo; The institution
has, perhaps, not developed exactly on the lines contemplated
by its promoters, but it has been very useful. The advantages
enjoyed by members of social clubs, with the addition of facilities
for educational classes and the use of an excellent news-room
and a well-selected library, are offered in return for a
payment which does not amount to a penny a day. The
mechanics&rsquo; institution has developed into the school of Technology,
which now forms a part of the university. The Portico
is a good specimen of the older proprietary libraries and newsrooms.
It dates from 1806, and has a library. The Memorial
Hall was built to commemorate the memory of the ejected
ministers of 1662; it is used for meetings, scientific, educational,
musical and religious. The Whitworth Institute is governed
by a corporate body originating from the liberal bequests
of Sir Joseph Whitworth. The Institute contains a valuable
collection of works of art and stands in the centre of a woodland
park. In the park, which has been transferred to the
corporation, is a sculpture group of &ldquo;Christ and the Children,&rdquo;
executed by George Tinworth from the designs of R. D. Darbishire,
by whom it was presented. The assize courts, built
from designs by Waterhouse (1864), the post office (1887),
and the police courts (1871) should also be named. Many
fine structures suffer from being hemmed in by streets which
prevent the proportions from being seen to advantage.</p>

<p><i>Monuments.</i>&mdash;In Piccadilly are bronze statues of Wellington,
Watt, Dalton, Peel and Queen Victoria. Another statue
of the Queen, by the Princess Louise, is placed on the new porch
of the cathedral. A bronze statue of Cobden occupies a prominent
position in St Ann&rsquo;s Square. There also is the South
African War Memorial of the Manchester Regiment. The
marble statue of the Prince Consort, covered by a Gothic canopy
of stone, is in front of the town hall, which dwarfs what would
otherwise be a striking monument. In Albert Square there
are also statues of Bishop Fraser, John Bright, Oliver Heywood
and W. E. Gladstone. A statue of J. P. Joule is in the town
hall, which also contains memorials of other worthies. The
Queen&rsquo;s Park has a statue of Benjamin Brierley, a well-known
writer in the Lancashire dialect. The most picturesque is
Matthew Noble&rsquo;s bronze statue of Cromwell, placed on a huge
block of rough granite as pedestal. It stands at the junction
of Deansgate and Victoria Street, near the cathedral, and was
presented to the town by Mrs E. S. Heywood.</p>

<p><i>Education.</i>&mdash;There are many educational facilities. The
oldest institution is the grammar school, which was founded
in 1519 by Hugh Oldham, bishop of Exeter, a native of the
town. The master and usher appointed by the bishop were
to teach freely every child and scholar coming to the school,
&ldquo;without any money or reward taken&rdquo;; and the bishop forbade
the appointment of any member of the religious orders as
head master. Some corn mills were devised for the maintenance
of the school, which was further endowed at both the
universities by Sarah, duchess of Somerset, in 1692. The
school has now two hundred and fifty free scholars, whilst
other pupils are received on payment of fees. Among those
educated at the grammar school were Thomas De Quincey,
Harrison Ainsworth and Samuel Bamford the Radical. After
the grammar school the oldest educational foundation is that
of Humphrey Chetham, whose bluecoat school, founded in
1653, is housed in the building formerly occupied by the college
of clergy. This also contains the public library founded by
Chetham, and is the most interesting relic of antiquity in the
city. The educational charity of William Hulme (1631-1691)
is administered under a scheme drawn up in 1881. Its income
is nearly £10,000 a year, and it supports a grammar school
and aids education in other ways. There are three high schools
for girls. The Nicholls hospital was founded in 1881 for the
education of orphan boys. Manchester was one of the first
places to adopt the powers given by Forster&rsquo;s Act of 1870,
and on the abolition of school boards the educational supervision
was transferred to a committee of the corporation strengthened
by co-opted members. In addition to the elementary
schools, the municipality provides a large and well-equipped
school of technology, and a school of art to which is attached
an arts and crafts museum. There are a pupil teachers&rsquo; college,
a school of domestic economy, special schools for feeble-minded
children, and a Royal College of Music. The schools for the
deaf and dumb are situated at Old Trafford, in a contiguous
building of the same Gothic design as the blind asylum, to
which Thomas Henshaw left a bequest of £20,000. There
is also an adult deaf and dumb institution, containing a
news-room, lecture hall, chapel, &amp;c., for the use of deaf
mutes.</p>

<p>The Victoria University of Manchester has developed from
the college founded by John Owens, who in 1846 bequeathed
nearly £100,000 to trustees for an institution in which should
be taught &ldquo;such branches of learning and science as were
then or might be hereafter usually taught in English universities.&rdquo;
It was opened in 1851 in a house which had formerly
been the residence of Cobden. In 1872 a new college building
was erected on the south side of the town from designs by
Waterhouse. In 1880 a university charter was granted, excluding
the faculties of theology and medicine, and providing for
the incorporation of University College, Liverpool, and the
College of Science, Leeds. The federal institution thus created
lasted until 1903, when the desire of Liverpool for a separate
university of its own led to a reconstruction. Manchester
University consists of one college&mdash;Owens College&mdash;in its
greatly enlarged form. The buildings include the Whitworth
Hall (the gift of the legatees of Sir Joseph Whitworth), the
Manchester Museum and the Christie Library, which is a
building for the university library given by R. C. Christie,
who also bequeathed his own collection. Dr Lee, the first
bishop of Manchester, left his library to Owens College, and
the legatees of Sir Joseph Whitworth bought and presented
E. A. Freeman&rsquo;s books. The library has received other important
special collections. The benefactions to the university
of Thomas Ashton are estimated at £80,000. There are in
Manchester a number of denominational colleges, Wesleyan,
Primitive Methodist, Unitarian, Baptist, &amp;c., and many of
the students preparing for the ministry receive their arts training
at the university, the theological degrees of which are open
to students irrespective of creed.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Libraries, Museums and Societies.</i>&mdash;Manchester is well provided
with libraries. The Chetham library, already named, contains some
rare manuscripts, the gem of the collection being a copy of the
historical compilation of Matthew Paris, with corrections in the
author&rsquo;s handwriting. There is a large collection of matter relating
to the history and archaeology of Lancashire and Cheshire, including
the transcripts of Lancashire MSS. bequeathed by Canon F. R.
Raines. The collections of broadsides formed by Mr J. O. Halliwell-Phillipps,
and the library of John Byrom, rich in mystics and shorthand
writers, should also be named. The Manchester Free Libraries
were founded by Sir John Potter in 1852. There is now a reference
library containing about 170,000 volumes, including an extensive
series of English historical works, a remarkable collection of books
of political economy and trade, and special collections relating to
local history, Dr Thomas Fuller, shorthand and the gipsies. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page547" id="page547"></a>547</span>
Henry Watson Music Library, and the Thomas Greenwood Library
for librarians were presented to the reference library, and the Foreign
Library was purchased. Affiliated to the reference library there are
nineteen libraries, each of which includes a lending department and
reading rooms. The municipal libraries contain in the aggregate over
366,000 vols. There are also libraries in connexion with the Athenaeum,
the School of Technology, the Portico, and many other institutions.
The most remarkable of the Manchester libraries is that
founded by Mrs Enriqueta Rylands, and named the John Rylands
Library in memory of her husband. The beautiful building was
designed by Basil Champneys; the library includes the famous
Althorp collection, which was bought from Earl Spencer. Mrs
Rylands died in 1908, and by her will increased the endowment of
the library so that it has an income of £13,000 yearly. She also
bequeathed her own library.</p>

<p>Manchester possesses numerous literary and scientific associations.
The oldest of these, the Literary and Philosophical Society, founded
in 1781, has a high reputation, and has numbered among its working
members John Dalton, Eaton Hodgkinson, William Fairbairn,
J. P. Joule, H. E. Roscoe and many other famous men of science. It
has published a series of memoirs and proceedings. The Manchester
Statistical Society was the first society of the kind established in the
kingdom, and has issued <i>Transactions</i> containing many important
papers. The Field Naturalists&rsquo; and Archaeologists&rsquo; Society, the
Microscopical Society, the Botanists&rsquo; Association, and the Geological
Society may also be named. Manchester is the headquarters of the
Lancashire and Cheshire Antiquarian Society and of several printing
clubs, the Chetham, the Record, the Lancashire Parish Registers
societies. Seven daily papers are published, and various weekly
and other periodicals. The journalism of Manchester takes high
rank, the <i>Manchester Guardian</i> (Liberal) being one of the best newspapers
in the country, while the <i>Manchester Courier</i> (Unionist) has an
important local influence. The <i>Manchester Quarterly</i> is issued by
the Manchester Literary Club, which was founded in 1862. The
success of the Art Treasures Exhibition in 1857 was repeated in the
Jubilee Exhibition of 1887. The Manchester Academy of Fine
Arts is a society of artists, and holds an annual exhibition in the city
art gallery.</p>

<p><i>Parks and Open Spaces.</i>&mdash;There are fifty-three parks and open
spaces. The Queen&rsquo;s Park, at Harpurhey, is pleasantly situated,
though surrounded by cottages and manufactories. Philips Park
is also attractive, in spite of its close proximity to some of the most
densely populated portions of the town. The Alexandra Park has
very good ornamental grounds and a fine cactus house with a remarkable
collection presented by Charles Darrah. Some of the open
spaces are small; Boggart Hole Clough, where great efforts have been
made to preserve the natural features, is 76 acres in extent, and was
the largest until 1902, when Heaton Park, containing 692 acres, was
purchased. It was formerly the seat of the earls of Wilton, and
includes Heaton House, one of Wyatt&rsquo;s structures. In the Queen&rsquo;s
Park there is a museum, and periodical exhibitions of works of art
are held. The total area of the city parks is 1146 acres. The
corporation are also responsible for four cemeteries, having a total
area of 228 acres.</p>

<p><i>Recreation.</i>&mdash;There are nine theatres, mostly large, and eight
music halls. The Theatre Royal was established as a patent theatre.
When the bill for it was before the House of Lords in 1775 it was
advocated as an antidote to Methodism. The Bellevue Zoological
Gardens is a favourite holiday place for working people. The
Ancoats Recreation Committee have since 1882 had Sunday lectures,
and occasional exhibitions of pictures, window gardening, &amp;c. The
Ancoats Art Museum was founded to carry out the educational
influences of art and culture generally. In addition to works of
art, there are concerts, lectures, reading circles, &amp;c. The museum
is worked in connexion with a university settlement. The German
element in the population has largely influenced the taste for music
by which Manchester is distinguished, and the orchestral concerts
(notably under Charles Hallé) are famous.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Population.</i>&mdash;From a census taken in 1773 it appears that
there were then in the township of Manchester and its out-townships
36,267 persons. The first decennial census, 1801,
showed the population to be 75,275; in 1851 it was 303,382;
in 1901, 606,824. It is not easy to make an exact comparison
between different periods, because there have been successive
enlargements of the boundaries. The population has overflowed
into the surrounding districts, and if all that belongs
to the urban area, of which it is the centre, were included,
greater Manchester would probably rival London in the number
of its inhabitants.</p>

<p><i>Manufactures and Commerce.</i>&mdash;Manchester is the centre
of the English cotton industry (for details see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Cotton</a></span> and
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Cotton Manufacture</a></span>), but owing to the enhanced value of
land many mills and workshops have been removed to the
outskirts and to neighbouring villages and towns, so that the
centre of Manchester and an ever-widening circle around are
now chiefly devoted not so much to production as to the various
offices of distribution. It would be a mistake, however, to
regard Manchester as solely dependent upon the industries
connected with cotton. There are other important manufactures
which in another community would be described as
gigantic. Wool and silk are manufactured on a considerable
scale, though the latter industry has for some years been on
the decline. The miscellaneous articles grouped under the
designation of small-wares occupy many hands. Machinery
and tools are made in vast quantities; the chemical industries
of the city are also on a large scale. In short, there are but
few important manufactures that are wholly unrepresented.
The proximity of Manchester to the rich coal-fields of Lancashire
has had a marked influence upon its prosperity; but
for this, indeed, the rapid expansion of its industries would
have been impossible.</p>

<p>The Manchester Bankers&rsquo; Clearing House returns show an
almost unbroken yearly increase. The amount in 1872 was
£72,805,510; in 1907 it was £320,296,332; by the severe depression
of 1908 it was reduced to £288,555,307. Another
test of prosperity is the increase in rateable value. In 1839
it was £669,994; in 1871, £1,703,627; in 1881, £2,301,225; in
1891, £2,798,005; in 1901, £3,394,879; in 1907, £4,191,039; in
1909, £4,234,129.</p>

<p>The commercial institutions of Manchester are too numerous
for detailed description; its chamber of commerce has for more
than sixty years exercised much influence on the trade of the
district and of the nation. Manchester is the headquarters
of the Co-operative Wholesale Society, and indeed of the cooperative
movement generally.</p>

<p>The most important event in the modern history of the
district is the creation of the Manchester Ship Canal (<i>q.v.</i>),
by which Manchester and Salford have a direct communication
with the sea at Eastham, near Liverpool. The canal
was opened for traffic in January 1894. The official opening ceremony
was on the 21st of May 1894, when Queen Victoria visited
Manchester. The total expenditure on capital account has
been £16,567,881. The original share capital of £8,000,000
and £1,812,000, raised by debentures, having been exhausted,
the corporation of Manchester advanced on loan a further sum
of £5,000,000.</p>

<p><i>Municipality.</i>&mdash;Manchester received a municipal charter
in 1838, received the title of city in 1853, and became a county
borough in 1889. The city is divided into 30 wards, and the
corporation consists of 31 aldermen and 93 councillors. The
mayor received the title of lord mayor in 1893. Unlike some
of the municipalities, that of Manchester makes no pecuniary
allowance to its lord mayor, and the office is a costly one.</p>

<p>The water supply is controlled by the corporation. The
works at Longdendale, begun in 1848, were completed, with
extensions in 1884, at a cost of £3,147,893. The area supplied
by Manchester waterworks was about 85 square miles, inhabited
by a million people. The increase of trade and population
led to the obtaining of a further supply from Lake Thirlmere,
at the foot of Helvellyn and 96 miles from Manchester. The
watershed is about 11,000 acres. The daily consumption
is over 38 million gallons. Manchester supplies in bulk to many
local authorities in the district between Thirlmere and the
city. The corporation have also established works for the
supply of hydraulic and electric power.</p>

<p>The gas lighting of Manchester has been in the hands of
the corporation for many years, as also the supply of electricity
both for lighting and energy. When the works are complete
the electricity committee will supply an area of 45 sq. m.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Sanitary Condition.</i>&mdash;Dr John Tatham constructed a Manchester
life-table based on the vital statistics of the decennium 1881-1890,
from which it appeared that, while in England and Wales of 1000
men aged 25 nearly 800 survived to be 45 and of 1000 aged 45, 569
survived to be 65, in Manchester the survivors were only 732 and 414
respectively. The expectation of life, at 25, was, for England and
Wales 36.12 years, and for Manchester 30.69 years. But the death-rate
has since rapidly decreased; in 1891 it was 26.0 per thousand
living; in 1901 it was 21.6; in 1906 it was 19.0; in 1907 it was 17.9.
The deaths of infants under one year old amounted to 169 per 1000.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page548" id="page548"></a>548</span>
The reports of the medical officer show that whilst the density of
the population, the impurity of the atmosphere, and the pollution of
the streams are difficult elements in the sanitary problem, great
efforts have been made towards improving the health of the people.
The birth-rate in 1907 was 28.4, but the population is augmented
by immigration as well as by natural increase. The number of
persons to the acre is 33.</p>

<p><i>Administration of Justice.</i>&mdash;The city has a stipendiary magistrate
who, in conjunction with lay magistrates, tries cases of summary
jurisdiction in the police courts. There are also quarter sessions,
presided over by a recorder. Separate sessions are held for the
Salford hundred. Certain sittings of the Court of Chancery for the
duchy of Lancaster are held in Manchester. In addition to the
county court, there is an ancient civil court known as the Salford
Hundred Court of Record. Assizes have been held since 1866.</p>

<p><i>Parliamentary Representation.</i>&mdash;By the first Reform Bill Manchester
received in 1832 two representatives. In 1868 this was increased
to three, but each voter had only two votes. In 1885 the city
was divided into six divisions, each returning one member. Owing
to the extension of the city boundaries there are Manchester voters
in the Stretford, Prestwich and Gorton parliamentary divisions.</p>
</div>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;Very little is known with certainty of the early
history of Manchester.<a name="fa1i" id="fa1i" href="#ft1i"><span class="sp">1</span></a> A Roman station of some importance
existed at Castlefield, and a fragment of the wall still exists.
Another, perhaps earlier, was at Hunt&rsquo;s Bank. In the 18th
century considerable evidences of Roman occupation were
still visible; and from time to time, in the course of excavation
(especially during the making of the Bridgewater Canal),
Roman remains have been found. The coins were chiefly
those of Vespasian, Antoninus Pius, Trajan, Hadrian, Nero,
Domitian, Vitellius and Constantine. Investigations by the
Lancashire and Cheshire Antiquarian Society and the Classical
Association have brought to light many relics, chiefly of pottery.
The period succeeding the Roman occupation is for some
time legendary. As late as the 17th century there was a tradition
that Tarquin, an enemy of King Arthur, kept the castle
of Manchester, and was killed by Lancelot of the Lake. The
references to the town in authentic annals are very few. It
was probably one of the scenes of the missionary preaching
of Paulinus; and it is said (though by a chronicler of comparatively
late date) to have been the residence of Ina, king
of Wessex, and his queen Ethelberga, after he had defeated
Ivor, somewhere about the year 689. Almost the only point
of certainty in its history before the Conquest is that it suffered
greatly from the devastations of the Danes, and that in 923
Edward, who was then at Thelwall, near Warrington, sent
a number of his Mercian troops to repair and garrison it. In
Domesday Book Manchester, Salford, Rochdale and Radcliffe
are the only places named in south-east Lancashire, a district
now covered by populous towns. Large portions of it were
then forest, wood and waste lands. Twenty-one thanes held
the manor or hundred of Salford among them. The church
of St Mary and the church of St Michael in Manchester are
both named in Domesday, and some difficulty has arisen as
to their proper identification. Some antiquaries consider
that the passage refers to the town only, whilst others think
it relates to the parish, and that, while St Mary&rsquo;s is the present
cathedral, St Michael&rsquo;s would be the present parish church of
Ashton-under-Lyne. In 1301 Manchester received a charter
of manorial liberties and privileges from its baron, Thomas
Gresley, a descendant of one to whom the manor had been
given by Roger of Poictou, who was created by William the
Conqueror lord of all the land between the rivers Mersey and
Ribble. The Gresleys were succeeded by the De la Warrs,
the last of whom was educated for the priesthood, and became
rector of the town. To avoid the evil of a non-resident clergy,
he made considerable additions to the lands of the church, in
order that it might be endowed as a collegiate institution. A
college of clergy was thus formed, whose fellows were bound
to perform the necessary services at the parish church, and
to whom the old baronial hall was granted as a place of residence.
The manorial rights passed to Sir Reginald West, a descendant of
Joan Gresley, who was summoned to parliament as Baron
de la Warre. The West family, in 1579, sold the manorial
rights for £3000 to John Lacy, who, in 1596, resold them to
Sir Nicholas Mosley, whose descendants enjoyed the emoluments
derived from them until 1845, when they were purchased
by the municipality of Manchester for a sum of £200,000.
The lord of the manor had the right to tax and toll all articles
brought for sale into the market of the town. But, though
the inhabitants were thus to a large extent taxed for the benefit
of one individual, they had a far greater amount of local self-government
than might have been supposed, and the court leet,
which was then the governing body of the town, had, though
in a rudimentary form, nearly all the powers now possessed
by municipal corporations. This court had not only control
over the watching and warding of the town, the regulation
of the water supply, and the cleaning of the streets, but also
had power, which at times was used freely, of interfering with
the private liberty of their fellow-citizens. Thus, no single
woman was allowed to be a householder; no person might
employ other than the town musicians; and the amount to
be spent at wedding feasts and other festivities was carefully
settled. Under the protection of the barons the town appears
to have steadily increased in prosperity, and it early became
an important seat of the textile manufactures. Fulling mills
were at work in the district in the 13th century; and documentary
evidence exists to show that woollen manufactures were
carried on in Ancoats at that period. In 1538 Leland described
it as &ldquo;the fairest, best-builded, quickest, and most populous
town in Lancashire.&rdquo; The right of sanctuary granted to the
town in 1540 was found so detrimental to its industrial pursuits
that after very brief experience the privilege was taken away.
The college of Manchester was dissolved in 1547, but was
refounded in Mary&rsquo;s reign. Under her successor the town
became the headquarters of the commission for establishing the
Reformed religion. In 1641 we hear of the Manchester people
purchasing linen yarn from the Irish, weaving it, and returning
it for sale in a finished state. They also brought cotton wool
from Smyrna to work into fustians and dimities. An act
passed in the reign of Edward VI. regulates the length of cottons
called Manchester, Lancashire and Cheshire cottons. These,
notwithstanding their name, were probably all woollen textures.
It is thought that some of the Flemish weavers who were introduced
into England by Queen Philippa of Hainault were settled
at Manchester; and Fuller has given an exceedingly quaint
and picturesque description of the manner in which these
artisans were welcomed by the inhabitants of the country they
were about to enrich with a new industry. The Flemish weavers
were in all probability reinforced by religious refugees from
the Low Countries.</p>

<p>In the civil wars, the town was besieged by the Royalists
under Lord Strange (better known as earl of Derby&mdash;&ldquo;the
great Stanley&rdquo;); but was successfully defended by the inhabitants
under the command of a German soldier of fortune,
Colonel Rosworm, who complained with some bitterness of
their ingratitude to him. An earlier affray between the Puritans
and some of Lord Strange&rsquo;s followers is said to have occasioned
the shedding of the first blood in the struggle between the
king and parliament. The year 1694 witnessed the trial of
those concerned in the so-called Lancashire plot, which ended
in the triumphant acquittal of the supposed Jacobites. That the
district really contained many ardent sympathizers with the
Stuarts was, however, shown in the rising of 1715, when
the clergy ranged themselves to a large extent on the side of
the Pretender; and was still more clearly shown in the rebellion
of 1745, when the town was occupied by Prince Charles Edward
Stuart, and a regiment, known afterwards as the Manchester
regiment, was formed and placed under the command of
Colonel Francis Townley. In the fatal retreat of the Stuart
troops the Manchester contingent was left to garrison Carlisle,
and surrendered to the duke of Cumberland. The officers
were taken to London, where they were tried for high treason
and beheaded on Kennington Common.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page549" id="page549"></a>549</span></p>

<p>The variations of political action in Manchester had been
exceedingly marked. In the 16th century, although it produced
both Roman Catholic and Protestant martyrs, it was
earnestly in favour of the Reformed faith, and in the succeeding
century it became indeed a stronghold of Puritanism. Yet
the successors of the Roundheads who defeated the army of
Charles I. were Jacobite in their sympathies, and by the latter
half of the 18th century had become imbued with the aggressive
form of patriotic sentiment known as anti-Jacobinism, which
showed itself chiefly in dislike of reform and reformers of every
description. A change, however, was imminent. The distress
caused by war and taxation, towards the end of the 18th and
the beginning of the 19th century, led to bitter discontent,
and the anomalies existing in the parliamentary system of
representation afforded only too fair an object of attack. While
single individuals in some portions of the country had the power
to return members of parliament for their pocket boroughs,
great towns like Manchester were entirely without representation.
The popular discontent was met by a policy of repression,
culminating in the affair of Peterloo, which may be regarded
as the starting-point of the modern reform agitation. This
was in 1819, when an immense crowd assembled on St Peter&rsquo;s
Fields (now covered by the Free Trade Hall and warehouses)
to petition parliament for a redress of their grievances. The
Riot Act was read by a clerical magistrate; but in such a manner
as to be quite unheard by the mass of the people; and drunken
yeomanry cavalry were then turned loose upon the unresisting
mass of spectators. The yeomanry appear to have used their
sabres freely; several people killed and many more injured;
and, although the magistrates received the thanks of the prince
regent and the ministry, their conduct excited the deepest
indignation throughout the entire country. Those who had
organized the meeting, including &ldquo;Orator&rdquo; Hunt with Samuel
Bamford and other working men, were imprisoned.</p>

<p>Naturally enough, the Manchester politicians took an important
part in the Reform agitation; when the Act of 1832 was
passed, the town sent as its representatives the Right Hon.
C. P. Thomson, vice-president of the board of trade, and
Mark Philips. With one notable exception, this was the first
time that Manchester had been represented in parliament
since its barons had seats in the House of Peers in the earlier
centuries. In 1654 Charles Worsley and R. Radcliffe were
nominated to represent it in Cromwell&rsquo;s parliament. Worsley
was a man of great ability, and has a place in history as the
man who carried out the injunction of the Protector to &ldquo;remove
that bauble,&rdquo; the mace of the House of Commons. The agitation
for the repeal of the corn laws had its headquarters at
Manchester, and the success which attended it, not less than
the active interest taken by its inhabitants in public questions,
has made the city the home of other projects of reform. The
&ldquo;United Kingdom Alliance for the Suppression of the Liquor
Traffic&rdquo; was founded there in 1853, and during the continuance
of the American War the adherents both of the North and of
the South deemed it desirable to have organizations in Manchester
to influence public opinion in favour of their respective
causes. A charter of incorporation was granted in 1838; a
bishop was appointed in 1847; and the town became a city in
1853. The Lancashire cotton famine, caused by the Civil
War in America, produced much distress in the Manchester
district, and led to a national movement to help the starving
operatives. The more recent annals of Manchester are a record
of industrial and commercial developments, and of increase
in educational opportunities of all kinds. Politically Manchester
was Liberal, of one or other shade, under the first
Reform Act; a Conservative member was first elected in 1868,
and in 1874 two. Under household suffrage in 1885 that
party secured five out of six members; in 1886 and 1892, three
out of six. In 1895 and 1900 five Unionists were elected, but
in 1906 six Liberals were returned, one of whom (Mr Winston
Churchill) was defeated at a by-election in 1908. In 1910
three Liberals, two Labour members and one Conservative
were elected.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><span class="sc">Authorities.</span>&mdash;Although several excellent books have been written
on subjects connected with the town, there is no adequate modern
history. The <i>History of Manchester</i>, by the Rev. John Whitaker,

(1900), 56,987; (1910 U.S. census) 70,063. Of the total population
in 1900, 24,257 were foreign-born, including 13,429 French-Canadians;
and 37,530 were of foreign parentage (both parents
foreign-born), including 18,839 of French-Canadian parentage.
Manchester is served by the Southern, the Western, the White
Mountains, and the Worcester Nashua &amp; Portland divisions of
the Boston &amp; Maine railroad, and by inter-urban electric lines.
It is situated on a plain about 90 ft. above the Merrimac river
(which is spanned here by three bridges), commands extensive
views of the beautiful Merrimac valley, and covers a land area
of about 33 sq. m. On the east side of the city are two connected
lakes known as Lake Massabesic (30 m. in circumference).
Manchester is known for the attractive appearance of the residence
districts in which the factory operatives live, detached
homes and &ldquo;corporation boarding-houses,&rdquo; instead of tenement
houses, being the rule. The Institute of Arts and Sciences
(incorporated in 1898) provides lecture courses and classes in
science, art and music. Among the other public buildings and
institutions are the United States Government building, the
city-hall, the county-court-house, the city library (1854; the
outgrowth of the Manchester Athenaeum, established in 1844),
St Anselm&rsquo;s College (R.C.), a Roman Catholic cathedral, four
Roman Catholic convents, the Elliot hospital, the Sacred Heart
hospital and the hospital of Notre Dame de Lourdes, the State
industrial school, the State house of correction, the Gale home
for aged women, an old ladies&rsquo; home (R.C.), St Martha&rsquo;s
home for working girls, the Manchester children&rsquo;s home and
four orphan asylums. In the largest of five public squares is
a soldiers&rsquo; monument, consisting of a granite column 50 ft. high,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page550" id="page550"></a>550</span>
surmounted by a statue of Victory. The city has two parks,
and in one of them, overlooking the Merrimac, is a monument
to the memory of General John Stark, who was born and was
buried here. The water-supply is obtained from Lake Massabesic.
Amoskeag Falls in the Merrimac are 55 ft. in height, and
by means of hydraulic canals Manchester is provided with a fine
water-power. Steam power is also used, and the city is by far
the most important manufacturing centre in the state. It is
extensively engaged in the manufacture of cotton goods, boots
and shoes, worsted goods, hosiery and other knit goods, and
locomotives; among the other manufactures are linen goods,
steam fire-engines, paper, edge tools, soap, leather, carriages and
beer. The value of the city&rsquo;s factory products increased from
$24,628,345 in 1900 to $30,696,926 in 1905, or 24.6%. In 1905
Manchester produced 24.8% of the total factory product of
the state. Manchester ranks fifth among the cities of the
United States in cotton manufacturing, and ninth among the
cities of the country in the manufacture of boots and shoes.</p>

<p>On account of the abundance of fish in the river here, Amoskeag
Falls and vicinity were a favourite resort of the Penacook Indians,
and it is said that John Eliot, the &ldquo;Apostle to the Indians,&rdquo;
preached to them here in the summer of 1651. The first white
settlement within the present limits of Manchester was made in
1722 by Scottish-Irish immigrants at Goffe&rsquo;s Falls, 5 m. below
Amoskeag Falls. In 1723 a cabin was built by some of these
immigrants at the greater falls, and gradually a small settlement
grew up there. In 1735 Massachusetts granted to a body of men
known as &ldquo;Tyng&rsquo;s Snow-Shoe Scouts&rdquo; and their descendants
a tract of land 3 m. wide along the east bank of the Merrimac,
designated as &ldquo;Tyng&rsquo;s Township.&rdquo; The Scottish-Irish claimed
this tract as part of their grant from New Hampshire, and there
arose between the rival claimants a bitter controversy which
lasted until May 1741, when the courts decided against the
Massachusetts claimants. In 1751 the territory formerly known
as &ldquo;Tyng&rsquo;s Township,&rdquo; and sometimes called &ldquo;Harrytown,&rdquo;
with portions of Chester and Londonderry, was incorporated
as a township under the name Derryfield; in 1810 the name was
changed to Manchester, the change having been suggested by
the town&rsquo;s manufacturing possibilities; and in 1846 Manchester
was chartered as a city. The first sawmill was erected as early
as 1736, and during the years from 1794 to 1807 a canal was
constructed around the Amoskeag Falls through which to carry
lumber. As late as 1830 the town had a population of only 877,
but in 1831 the Amoskeag Manufacturing Company was incorporated,
the construction of hydraulic canals and the erection of
cotton mills followed, the villages of Piscataquog and Amoskeag
were annexed in 1853, and the population increased to 3235 in
1840, to 8841 in 1860, and to 33,592 in 1880.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MANCHESTER SHIP CANAL.<a name="ar51" id="ar51"></a></span> The advantage of a waterway
for the conveyance of goods between eastern Lancashire and the
sea is so obvious that so far back as the year 1721 Thomas Steers
designed a plan for continuing to Manchester the barge navigation
which then existed between Liverpool and Warrington.
Parliamentary powers were then obtained to improve the rivers
Mersey and Irwell from Warrington to Manchester by means of
locks and weirs. This work was successfully carried out, and
proved of great benefit to the trade of the district. The duke
of Bridgewater, who had made a canal from his collieries at
Worsley to Manchester, afterwards continued the canal to the
Mersey at Runcorn; this extension was opened in 1722 and competed
with the Mersey and Irwell navigation, both routes being
navigated by barges carrying about fifty tons of cargo. The
Liverpool &amp; Manchester railway at a later date afforded further
facilities for conveyance of goods, but the high rates of carriage,
added to heavy charges at the Liverpool docks, prejudiced trade,
and the question was mooted of a ship canal to bring cotton,
timber, grain and other goods direct to Manchester without
transshipment. The first plan was made by William Chapman
in 1825, and was followed by one designed by Henry Palmer in
1840, but it was not until the year 1882 that the movement was
originated that culminated in the opening of the Manchester
Ship Canal by Queen Victoria on the 21st of May 1894.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>In determining the plan of the canal the main point which arose
was whether it should be made with locks or whether it should be
on the sea-level throughout, and therefore tidal. The advantage
of a still waterway in navigating large steamers, and the facilities
afforded by one constant water-level for works on the banks and the
quick discharge of goods at the terminal docks at Manchester, secured
the adoption of the plans for a canal with locks as designed by Sir
E. Leader Williams. The fresh-water portion of the canal extended
between Manchester and Runcorn, while from the latter place to Garston
it was proposed to improve the upper Mersey estuary by constructing
training walls and dredging to form a deep central channel.
Parliamentary powers to construct the canal were sought in the
session of 1883, when the bill passed the committee of the House of
Commons but was rejected by the committee of the House of Lords.
Brought forward again the next year, it was passed by the Lords but
thrown out by the Commons. The opposition from Liverpool and
the railway companies was very strong; to meet to some extent that
of the former, a continuation of the canal was proposed from Runcorn
to Eastham along the Cheshire side of the Mersey, instead of a trained
channel in the estuary, and in this form the bill was again introduced
in the session of 1885, and, notwithstanding strong opposition, was
passed by both houses of parliament. The cost of this contest to
promoters and opponents exceeded £400,000, the various committees
on the bill having sat over 175 days. Owing to difficulties in raising
the capital the works were not begun until November 1887.</p>

<p>The total length of the canal is 35½ m. and it may be regarded
as divided into three sections. From Eastham to Runcorn it is
near or through the Mersey estuary for 12¾ m., and thence to
Latchford near Warrington, 8¼ m., it is inland; both these sections
have the same water-level, which is raised by high tides. At Latchford
the locks stop tidal action, and the canal is fed by the waters
of the rivers Mersey and Irwell from that point to Manchester,
14½ m. from Latchford. The canal begins on the Cheshire side of the
Mersey at Eastham, about 6 m. above Liverpool. The entrance
is well sheltered and adjoins a good low-water channel communicating
with the Sloyne deep at Liverpool. Three entrance locks have
been provided close to and parallel with each other, their length and
width being 600 by 80, 350 by 50, and 150 by 30 ft. These locks
maintain the water-level in the canal nearly to mean high-water
level (14 ft. 2 in. above the Liverpool datum); when the tide
rises above that height the lock gates are opened and the tide flows
up to Latchford, giving on high spring tides an additional depth of
water of about 7 ft. On the ebb tide this water is returned to the
Mersey through large sluices at Randles Creek and at the junction
of the river Weaver with the canal, the level of the canal thus being
reduced to its normal height. The canal throughout to Manchester
has a minimum depth of 28 ft.; the depth originally was 26 ft., but
the lock sills were placed 2 ft. lower to allow of the channel being
dredged to 28 ft. when necessary. The minimum width at bottom
is 120 ft., allowing large vessels to pass each other at any point on
the canal; this width is considerably increased at the locks and other
parts. The slopes are generally about 1½ to 1, but are flatter through
some portions; in rock-cutting the sides are nearly vertical. From
Eastham to Runcorn the canal is alternately inland and on the
foreshore of the estuary, on which embankments were constructed
to act as dams and keep out the tide during the excavation of the
canal, and afterwards to maintain the water-level at low water in
the estuary; both sides are faced with heavy coursed stone. The
material for the embankments was principally clay excavated from
the cuttings. In some places, where the foundation was of a porous
nature, sheeting piles of timber had to be used. At Ellesmere Port,
where the embankment is 6200 ft. long on sand, 13,000 whole timber
sheeting piles 35 ft. long were driven, to secure the base of the
embankment on each side; water jets under pressure through 1½ in.
wrought-iron pipes were used at the foot of each pile to assist
the sinking, which was found most difficult by ordinary means. At
the river Weaver ten Stoney roller sluices are built, each 30 ft. span,
with heavy stone and concrete piers and foundations; at Runcorn,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page551" id="page551"></a>551</span>
where the river Mersey is narrow, a concrete sea-wall 4300 ft.
long was substituted for the embankment. At various points
under the canal cast-iron siphon pipes were laid to carry off any land
drainage which was at a lower level than the canal; the largest of these
siphons were constructed to allow the tidal and fresh water of the
river Gowy to pass under the canal at Stanlow Point, between
Eastham and Ellesmere Port. Two 12-ft. siphons are there placed
close together, built of cast-iron segments; they are each 400 ft. long,
and were laid on concrete 4 ft. below the bottom of the canal. From
Runcorn to Latchford the canal is nearly straight, the depth of
cutting varying from 35 to 70 ft., partly in rock, but generally in
alluvial deposit. The whole length of the canal passes through the
New Red Sandstone formation, with its overlying beds of gravel,
clay, sand and silt, which gave much trouble during the progress
of the work; retaining walls of stone and brickwork had to be built
in these places to maintain the sides of the canal from slips and injury
from the wash of steamers.</p>

<p>The canal from Latchford to Manchester is in heavy cutting
through the valleys of the rivers Mersey and Irwell. As these rivers
are circuitous in course, only very small portions could be utilized
in forming the canal; a line as nearly straight as possible was therefore
adopted, and involved many crossings of the river channels.
During the whole progress of the work these had to be kept open for
the discharge of floods and land water, and in some places temporary
cuts of considerable length had to be made for the same object. In
November 1890 and December 1891 high winter floods covered the
whole of the river valleys, filling many miles of the unfinished canal
and causing great damage to the slopes. Altogether 23 m. of
canal had to be pumped out to enable the work to be completed.
After the cuttings between the river channels were finished, the end
dams were removed, and the rivers Irwell and Mersey were turned
into the new channel now forming the upper portion of the ship canal.
The total rise to the level of the docks at Manchester from the ordinary
level of the water in the tidal portion of the canal below Latchford
locks is 60 ft. 6 in.; this is obtained by an average rise of about 15 ft.
at each of the sets of locks at Latchford, Irlam (7½ m. nearer
Manchester), Barton (2 m. farther) and Mode Wheel (3½ m. above
Barton locks at the entrance to the Manchester docks). For
the greater part of this last length the canal is widened at bottom
from 120 ft., its normal width, to 170 ft., to enable vessels to lie at
timber and other wharves without interfering with the passage of
large vessels to or from the docks. The locks are in duplicate, one
being 600 ft. long by 65 ft. wide, the other 350 ft. long by 45 ft. wide,
with Stoney&rsquo;s sluices adjacent. They are filled or emptied in five
minutes by large culverts on each side with side openings into the
lock. Concrete with facings of blue Staffordshire brick is largely
used, and the copings, sills, hollow quoins and fender courses are of
Cornish granite. The lock gates are constructed of greenheart
timber. The sluices near the locks take the place of the weirs
used in the old Mersey and Irwell navigation; they are 30 ft. span
each, four being generally used at each set of locks. In ordinary
seasons any water not used for lockage purposes passes over the tops
of the sluices, which are kept closed; in flood times the sluices are
raised to a height which will pass off floods with a comparatively
small rise in the canal. There are eight hydraulic installations on
the canal, each having duplicate steam-engines and boilers; the
mains exceed 7 m. in length, the pressure being 700 &#8468; to the inch.
They work the cranes, lifts and capstans at the docks, lock gates and
culvert sluices, coal tips, swing bridges and aqueduct.</p>

<p>At Barton, near Manchester, the Bridgewater canal crosses the
river Irwell on the first navigable aqueduct constructed in England.
It was the work of James Brindley, and since it was built at only
sufficient height to allow of barges passing under it, means had to
be found to allow of this important canal being maintained, and yet
to permit steamers to use the ship canal below it. Brindley&rsquo;s canal
is on one level throughout its whole length, and as its water supply
is only sufficient for the flight of locks by which it descends at Runcorn
to the Mersey, locks down to the ship canal would have involved
the waste of a lock of water on each side and caused serious delay
to the traffic. Sir E. Leader Williams surmounted the difficulty
by means of a swing aqueduct for the Bridgewater canal, which when
closed enables the traffic to pass as before, while it is opened to allow
of ships crossing it on the lower level of the ship canal. The water
in the swing portions of the aqueduct when opened is retained by
closing gates at each end, similar gates being shut at the same time
across the fixed portion of the aqueduct. The swing portion is a
large steel trough carried by side girders, 234 ft. long and 33 ft. high
in the centre, tapering 4 ft. to the ends; the waterway is 19 ft. wide
and 6 ft. deep. The whole works on a central pier with similar
arrangements to the largest swing bridges on the canal; it has two
spans over the ship canal of 90 ft. each. It is somewhat singular
that the first fixed canal aqueduct in England should, after the lapse
of 136 years, be replaced by the first swing aqueduct ever constructed.
The swing aqueduct is moved by hydraulic power, and has never
given any trouble in working, even in times of severe frost. The
weight of the movable portion, including the water, is 1600 tons.</p>

<p>The manner of dealing with the five lines of railways that were
cut through by the canal was one of importance, both in the interests
of the travelling public and the trade on the canal; they are all lines
with a heavy traffic, including the main line of the London &amp; North
Western railway near Warrington, with its important route to
Scotland. Swing bridges, although in use on some lines to cross
navigations, are dangerous and inconvenient, and high-level deviation
lines were adopted for each railway crossing the canal. No
such alteration of a railway had been previously sanctioned by parliament,
and it was only the importance of a ship canal to Manchester
that secured the requisite powers against the strong opposition of
the railway companies. Embankments were made close to and
parallel with the old lines, beginning about a mile and a quarter
from the canal on each side, the canal itself being crossed by
viaducts which give a clear headway of 75 ft. at ordinary water-level.
Vessels with high masts trading on the canal are provided
with telescopic or sliding top-masts. The gradients on the
railways rising up to the viaducts are 1 in 135. The span of the
viaducts is so arranged as to maintain the full width of the canal
for navigation; and as the railways generally cross the canal on the
skew, this necessitated girders in some cases of 300 ft. span. There
are nine main roads requiring swing bridges across the canal; all below
Barton have a span giving a clear waterway of 120 ft. The width
of these bridges varies with the importance of the roads from 20 to
36 ft., and they are constructed of steel, their weight ranging from
500 to 1000 tons each. They work on a live ring of conical cast-iron
rollers and are moved by hydraulic power supplied by steam, gas or
oil engines. The Trafford Road bridge at the docks at Manchester
is the heaviest swing bridge on the canal; being of extra width, it
weighs 1800 tons.</p>

<p>The canal being virtually one long dock, wharves at various
points have been erected to enable chemical or manufacturing works
to be carried on, widenings being provided where necessary. At
Ellesmere Port coal tips and sheds have been erected, and the canal
is in direct communication with the docks there as well as at Weston
Point and Runcorn, where a large trade is carried on with the
Staffordshire Potteries and the Cheshire salt districts. At Partington
branches from the railways connect the canal with the Yorkshire
and Lancashire coal-fields, and the canal is widened out 65 ft. on
each side for six hydraulic coal tips. At Mode Wheel there are
extensive abattoirs and lairages, erected by the Manchester Corporation;
also large petroleum oil tanks, graving dock and pontoons, cold-air
meat stores and other accommodation for traffic. At Manchester
the area of the docks is 104 acres, with 152 acres of quay space,
having over 5 m. of frontage to the docks, which are provided with
a number of three-storey transit sheds, thirteen seven-storey and
seven four-storey warehouses, and a large grain silo. The London &amp; North
Western and Lancashire &amp; Yorkshire railway companies and
the Cheshire Lines Committee have made branch lines to the docks,
the railways and sidings at which are over 30 miles in length. Much
traffic is also carted, or dealt with by inland canals in direct communication
with the docks. The substitution of a wide and deep
canal, nearly straight, for comparatively shallow and narrow winding
rivers, and the use of large sluices in place of fixed weirs to carry off
the river water, have been of great advantage to the district in
greatly reducing the height of floods.</p>

<p>The total amount of excavation in the canal, docks and subsidiary
work amounted to over 54 million cub. yds., nearly one-fourth of
which was sandstone rock; the excavated material was used in
forming the railway deviation embankments, filling up the old beds
of the rivers and raising low lands near the canal. As many men
were employed on the works as could be obtained, but the number
never exceeded 17,000, and the greater part of the excavation was
done by about eighty steam navvies and land dredgers. For the
conveyance of excavation and materials, 228 miles of temporary
railway lines were laid, and 173 locomotives, 6300 wagons and
trucks, and 316 fixed and portable steam-engines and cranes were
employed, the total cost of the plant being nearly £1,000,000. The
expenditure on the works, including plant and equipment, to the
1st of January 1900, was £10,327,666. The purchase of the Mersey
and Irwell and Bridgewater navigations (£1,786,651), land and
compensation (£1,223,809), interest on capital during constructions
(£1,170,733), and parliamentary, superintendence and general
expenses brought up the total amount to £15,248,437.</p>

<p>The traffic on the canal gradually increased from 925,659 tons in
1894 to 2,778,108 tons in 1899 and 5,210,759 tons in 1907. After
its opening considerable reductions were made in the railway rates
of carriage and the charges at the Liverpool docks in order to meet
the lower cost of conveyance by shipping passing up it. The result
has been of great advantage to the trade of Lancashire and the surrounding
districts, and the saving in the cost of carriage, estimated
at £700,000 a year, assists manufacturers to meet the competition
of their foreign opponents who have the advantage of low rates of
carriage on the improved waterways of America, Germany, France
and Belgium. Before the construction of the canal, large manufacturers
had left Manchester to establish their works at ports like
Glasgow, where they could save the cost of inland carriage. Since
its opening, new industries have been started at Manchester and along
its banks, warehouses and mills that were formerly empty are now
occupied, while nearly 10,000 new houses have been built for the
accommodation of the workpeople required to meet the enlarged trade
of the city.</p>

The territory thus defined is about 800 m. in length and 500 m.
in width, and contains about 390,000 sq. m. It is divided into
three provinces, viz. Hei-lung-kiang or Northern Manchuria,
Kirin or Central Manchuria, and Sh&#275;ng-king or Southern Manchuria.
Physically the country is divided into two regions, the
one a series of mountain ranges occupying the northern and
eastern portions of the kingdom, and the other a plain which
stretches southwards from Mukden, the capital, to the Gulf of
Liao-tung.</p>

<p>A system of parallel ranges of mountains, culminating in the
Chinese Ch&rsquo;ang pai Shan, &ldquo;the long white mountains,&rdquo; on the
Korean frontier, runs in a north-easterly direction from the
shores of the Gulf of Liao-tung. In its course through Eastern
Manchuria it forms the watershed of the Sungari, Usuri and
other rivers, and in the south that of the Ya-lu and many smaller
streams. It also forms the eastern boundary of the great plain
of Liao-tung. The mountains of this system reach their greatest
height on the south-east of Kirin, where their snow-capped peaks
rise to the elevation of 8000 ft. The scenery among them is
justly celebrated, more especially in the neighbourhood of
Haich&lsquo;&#275;ng, Siu-yen and the Korean Gate.</p>

<p>The three principal rivers of Manchuria are the Sungari, Mutan-kiang
and Usuri already mentioned. Of these the Sungari,
which is the largest, rises on the northern slopes of the Ch&rsquo;ang pai
Shan range, and runs in a north-westerly direction to its junction
with the Nonni, from which point it turns north-east until it
empties itself into the Amur. It is navigable by native junks
above Kirin, which city may also be reached by steamer. In
its long course it varies greatly both in depth and width, in some
parts being only a few feet deep and spreading out to a width
of more than a mile, while in other and mountainous portions
of its course its channel is narrowed to 300 or 400 ft., and its
depth is increased in inverse ratio. The Usuri rises in about 44°
N. and 131° E., and after running a north-easterly course for
nearly 500 m. it also joins the Amur. The Mutan-kiang takes
its rise, like the Sungari, on the northern slopes of the Ch&rsquo;ang pai
Shan range, and not far from the sources of that river. It takes
a north-easterly course as far as the city of Ninguta, at which
point it turns northward, and so continues until it joins the
Sungari at San-sing. It is navigable by junks between that city
and Ninguta, though the torrents in its course make the voyage
backwards and forwards one of considerable difficulty. Next
in importance to these rivers are the Liao and Ya-lu, the former
of which rises in Mongolia, and after running in an easterly direction
for about 400 m. enters Manchuria in about 43° N., and
turning southward empties itself into the Gulf of Liao-tung.
The Ya-lu rises in Korea, and is the frontier river of that
country.</p>

<p><i>Provinces and Towns.</i>&mdash;Mukden, or as it is called by the Chinese
Sh&#275;ng-king, the capital city of Manchuria, is situated in the
province of Sh&#275;ng-king, occupies a fine position on the river
Hun-ho, an affluent of the Liao, and is a city of considerable pretensions.
Liao-yang, which was once the capital of the country,
is also in the province of Sh&#275;ng-king. The other cities in the
province are Kin-chow-fu on the west of the Gulf of Liao-tung;
Kin-chow, on the western extremity of the Liao-tung peninsula;
Kai-ping, on the north-western shore of the same peninsula;
Hai-ch&#275;ng, on the road from Niu-chwang to Mukden; Ki-yuen,
a populous and prosperous city in the north of the province; and
Sing-king, east of Mukden, the original seat of the founders of
the present dynasty. The most important commercial place,
however, is the treaty port of Niu-chwang, at the head of the
Gulf of Liao-tung. According to the custom-house returns the
value of the foreign imports and exports in the year 1880 was
£691,954 and £1,117,790 respectively, besides a large native
trade carried on in junks. In 1904 the value of foreign imports
had risen to £2,757,962, but the exports amounted to £1,742,859
only, the comparatively low figure being accounted for by the
Russo-Japanese war.</p>

<p>The province of Kirin, or Central Manchuria, is bounded on the
N. and N.W. by the Sungari, on the S. by Sh&#275;ng-king and Korea,
on the W. by Mongolia, and on the E. by the Usuri and the
maritime Russian province. It contains an area of about 90,000
sq. m., and is entirely mountainous with the exception of a stretch
of plain country in its north-western corner. This plain produces
large quantities of indigo and opium, and is physically remarkable
for the number of isolated conical hills which dot its surface.
These sometimes occur in a direct line at intervals of 15 or 20 m.,
and elsewhere are scattered about &ldquo;like dish-covers on a table.&rdquo;
Kirin, the capital of the province, occupies a magnificent position,
being surrounded on the north, west and south by a semicircular
range of mountains with the broad stream of the Sungari flowing
across the front. The local trade is considerable. A-She-ho,
on the Ashe, with a population of 60,000; Petuna (Chinese, Sing-chung),
on the Sungari, population 30,000; San-sing, near the
junction of the Sungari and Mutan-kiang; La-lin, 120 m. to the
north of Kirin, population 20,000; Harbin or Kharbin and
Ninguta are the other principal cities in the province.</p>

<p>Hei-lung-kiang, or Northern Manchuria, which contains about
195,000 sq. m., is bounded on the N. and N.E. by the Amur, on
the S. by the Sungari, and on the W. by the Nonni and Mongolia.
It is traversed by the Great and Lesser Khingan mountains
and their offshoots. This province is thinly populated, and is
cultivated only along the lines of its rivers. The only towns of
any importance are Tsitsihar and Mergen, both situated on the
Nonni and Khailar in the west.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Climate, Flora, Fauna.</i>&mdash;The climate over the greater part of the
country varies between extremes of heat and cold, the thermometer
ranging between 90° F. in the summer and 10° below zero in the
winter. As in the north of China, the rivers are frozen up
during the four winter months. After a short spring the heat of
summer succeeds, which in its turn is followed by an autumn of
six weeks&rsquo; duration. The great plain in Sh&#275;ng-king is in many
parts swampy, and in the neighbourhood of the sea, where the
soil emits a saline exudation such as is also common in the
north of China, it is perfectly sterile. In other parts fine crops
of millet and various kinds of grain are grown, and on it trees
flourish abundantly. The trees and plants are much the same as
those common in England, and severe as the weather is in winter
the less elevated mountains are covered to their summits with
trees. The wild animals also are those known in Europe, with the
addition of tigers and panthers. Bears, wild boars, hares, wolves,
foxes and wild cats are very common, and in the north sables are
found in great numbers. One of the most noticeable of the birds
is the Mongolian lark (<i>Melanocorypha mongolica</i>), which is found
in a wild state both in Manchuria and in the desert of Mongolia.
This bird is exported in large numbers to northern China, where it
is much prized on account of its extraordinary power of imitation.
The Manchurian crane is common, as also are eagles, cuckoos,
laughing doves, &amp;c. Insects abound, owing to the swampy nature
of much of the country. The rivers are well stocked with fish,
especially with salmon, which forms a common article of food. In
such immense shoals do these fish appear in some of the smaller
streams that numbers are squeezed out on to the banks and there
perish.</p>

<p><i>Products and Industries.</i>&mdash;In minerals Manchuria is very rich:
coal, gold, iron (as well as magnetic iron ore), and precious stones
are found in large quantities. Gold mines are worked at several
places in the northern part of Manchuria, of which the principal are
on the Muho river, an affluent of the Amur, and near the Russian
frontier. Mines are also worked at Kwanyin-shan, opposite the
Russian frontier town of Radevska, and at Chia-pi-kou, on an
affluent of the upper Sungari. Indigo and opium are the most
lucrative crops. The indigo plant is grown in large quantities in
the plain country to the north of Mukden, and is transported thence
to the coast in carts, each of which carries rather more than a ton
weight of the dye. The poppy is cultivated wherever it will grow,
the crop being far more profitable than that of any other
product. Cotton, tobacco, pulse, millet, wheat and barley are also
grown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page553" id="page553"></a>553</span></p>

<p><i>Population.</i>&mdash;The population is estimated as follows for each of
the three divisions:&mdash;</p>

<table class="ws" summary="Contents">

<p><i>Communications.</i>&mdash;Four principal highways traverse Manchuria.
The first runs from Peking to Kirin via Mukden, where it sends off
a branch to Korea. At Kirin it bifurcates, one branch going to
San-sing, the extreme north-eastern town of the province of Kirin,
and the other to Possiet Bay on the coast via Ninguta. The second
road runs from the treaty port of Niu-chwang through Mukden to
Petuna in the north-western corner of the Kirin province, and thence
to Tsitsihar, Mergen and the Amur. The third also starts from
Niu-chwang, and strikes southward to Kin-chow at the extremity
of the Liao-tung peninsula. The fourth connects Niu-chwang with
the Gate of Korea.</p>

<div class="center ptb2"><img style="width:780px; height:947px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img553.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>The original Manchurian railway was constructed under an agreement
made in 1896 between the Chinese government and the Russo-Chinese
bank, an institution founded in 1895 to develop
Russian interests in the East. The Chinese Eastern
<span class="sidenote">Manchurian Railways.</span>
Railway Company was formed by the bank under this
agreement, to construct and work the line, and surveys were made
in 1897, the town of Harbin being founded as headquarters for the
work. The line, which affords through communication from Europe
by way of the Trans-Siberian system, enters Manchuria near a
station of that name in the north-west corner of the country, passes
Khailar, and runs south-east, near Tsitsihar, to Harbin. Thence
the main line continues in the same general direction to the eastern
frontier of Manchuria, and so to Vladivostok. In 1898 Russia
obtained a lease of the Liao-tung peninsula, and a clause of this
contract empowered her to connect Port Arthur and Dalny (now
Tairen) with the main Manchurian railway by a branch southward
from Harbin. In spite of interruption caused by the Boxer outbreak,
through communication was established in 1901. Under the Russo-Japanese
treaty of August 1905, after the war, supplemented by a
convention between Japan and China concluded in December of the
same year, Japan took over the line from Port Arthur as far as
Kwang-ch&#275;ng-tsze, now known as the Southern Manchurian railway
(508 m.). Branches were promoted (<i>a</i>) from Mukden to Antung
on the Ya-lu, to connect with the Korean system, and (<i>b</i>) from
Kwang-ch&#275;ng-tsze to Kirin. The rest of the original Manchurian
system (1088 miles) remains under Russian control. In the south-west
of Manchuria a line of the imperial railways of Northern China
gives connexion from Peking, and
Branches at Kou-pang-tsze to Sin-min-ting
and to Niu-chwang, and
the link between Sin-min-ting and
Mukden is also under Chinese control.
The lines now under Russian control
were laid down, and remain, on the
5 ft. gauge which is the Russian
standard; but after the Russian control
of the southern lines was lost
the gauge was altered from that
standard.</p>
</div>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;Manchu, as has been
said, is not the name of the country
but of the people who inhabit it.
The name was adopted by a ruler
who rose to power in the beginning
of the 13th century. Before
that time the Manchus were more
or less a shifting population, and,
being broken up into a number
of tribes, they went mainly under
the distinctive name of those clans
which exercised lordship over them.
Thus under the Cbow dynasty
(1122-225 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) they were known
as Sewshin, and at subsequent
periods as Yih-low, Wuh-keih,
Moh-hoh, Pohai, Nüchih and according
to the Chinese historians
also as Khitan. Throughout their
history they appear as a rude
people, the tribute they brought
to the Chinese court consisting
of stone arrow-heads, hawks, gold,
and latterly ginseng. Assuming
that, as the Chinese say, the
Khitans were Manchus, the first
appearance of the Manchus, as a
people, in China dates from the
beginning of the 10th century,
when the Khitans, having first
conquered the kingdom of Pohai,
crossed the frontier into China
and established the Liao or Iron
dynasty in the northern portion
of the empire. These invaders
were in their turn overthrown two
centuries later by another invasion
from Manchuria. These new conquerors
were Nüchihs, and therefore direct ancestors of the
Manchus. On assuming the imperial yellow in China their
chief adopted the title of Kin or &ldquo;Golden&rdquo; for his dynasty.
&ldquo;Iron&rdquo; (Liao), he said, &ldquo;rusts, but gold always keeps its
purity and colour, therefore my dynasty shall be called Kin.&rdquo;
In a little more than a century, however, the Kins were
driven out of China by the Mongols under Jenghiz Khan.
But before the close of their rule a miraculous event occurred
on the Chang-pai-Shan mountains which is popularly believed
to have laid the seeds of the greatness of the present rulers
of the empire. Three heaven-born maidens, so runs the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page554" id="page554"></a>554</span>
legend, were bathing one day in a lake under the Chang-pai-Shan
mountains when a passing magpie dropped a ripe red fruit into
the lap of one of them. The maiden ate the fruit, and in due
course a child was born to her, whom she named Aisin Gioro, or
the Golden. When quite a lad Aisin Gioro was elected chief
over three contending clans, and established his capital at Otoli
near the Chang-pai-Shan mountains. His reign, however, was
brief, for his subjects rose and murdered him, with all his sons
except the youngest, Fancha, who, like the infant Haitu in
Mongolian history, was miraculously saved. Nothing is recorded
of the facts of Aisin Gioro&rsquo;s reign except that he named
the people over whom he reigned Manchu, or &ldquo;Pure.&rdquo; His
descendants, through the rescued Fancha, fell into complete
obscurity until about the middle of the 16th century, when one
of them, Nurhachu by name, a chieftain of a small tribe, rose to
power. Nurhachu played with skill and daring the rôle which
had been played by Jenghiz Khan more than three centuries
before in Mongolia. With even greater success than his Mongolian
counterpart, Nurhachu drew tribe after tribe under his
sway, and after numerous wars with Korea and Mongolia he
established his rule over the whole of Manchuria. Being thus
the sovereign of an empire, he, again like Jenghiz Khan, adopted
for himself the title of Ying-ming, &ldquo;Brave and Illustrious,&rdquo; and
took for his reign the title of T&rsquo;ien-ming. Thirteen years later,
in 1617, after numerous border fights with the Chinese, Nurhachu
drew up a list of &ldquo;seven hates,&rdquo; or indictments, against his
southern neighbours, and, not getting the satisfaction he demanded,
declared war against them. The progress of this war,
the peace hastily patched up, the equally hasty alliance and its
consequences, being matters of Chinese history, are treated in
the article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">China</a></span>.</p>

<p>Manchuria was claimed by Russia as her particular sphere of
interest towards the close of the 19th century, and in the course
of the disturbances of 1900 Russian troops occupied various
parts of the country. Eventually a Manchurian convention
was arranged between China and Russia, by which Russia was
to evacuate the province; but no actual ratification of this convention
was made by Russia. The Anglo-German agreement
of October 1900, to which Japan also became a party, and by
which it was agreed to &ldquo;maintain undiminished the territorial
condition of the Chinese empire,&rdquo; was considered by Great
Britain and Japan not to exclude Manchuria; but Germany, on
the other hand, declared that Manchuria was of no interest to
her. The Anglo-Japanese treaty of 1902, however, was ostensibly
directed towards the preservation of Manchuria in Chinese
hands. British capital has been invested in the extension of
the Chinese Northern railway to Niu-chwang, and the fact was
officially recognized by an agreement between Great Britain and
Russia in 1899. One result of the Russo-Japanese War was the
evacuation of Manchuria by the Russians, which, after the conclusion
of peace in 1905, was handed over by Japan to China.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MANCINI, PASQUALE STANISLAO<a name="ar53" id="ar53"></a></span> (1817-1888), Italian
jurist and statesman, was born at Castel Baronia, in the province
of Avellino, on the 17th of March 1817. At Naples, where he
studied law and displayed great literary activity, he rapidly
acquired a prominent position, and in 1848 was instrumental
in persuading Ferdinand II. to participate in the war against
Austria. Twice he declined the offer of a portfolio in the Neapolitan
cabinet, and upon the triumph of the reactionary party
undertook the defence of the Liberal political prisoners. Threatened
with imprisonment in his turn, he fled to Piedmont, where
he obtained a university professorship and became preceptor
of the crown prince Humbert. In 1860 he prepared the legislative
unification of Italy, opposed the idea of an alliance between
Piedmont and Naples, and, after the fall of the Bourbons, was
sent to Naples as administrator of justice, in which capacity he
suppressed the religious orders, revoked the Concordat, proclaimed
the right of the state to Church property, and unified
civil and commercial jurisprudence. In 1862 he became minister
of public instruction in the Rattazzi cabinet, and induced the
Chamber to abolish capital punishment. Thereafter, for fourteen
years, he devoted himself chiefly to questions of international
law and arbitration, but in 1876, upon the advent of the Left to
power, became minister of justice in the Depretis cabinet. His
Liberalism found expression in the extension of press freedom,
the repeal of imprisonment for debt, and the abolition of ecclesiastical
tithes. During the Conclave of 1878 he succeeded, by
negotiations with Cardinal Pecci (afterwards Leo XIII.), in
inducing the Sacred College to remain in Rome, and, after the
election of the new pope, arranged for his temporary absence
from the Vatican for the purpose of settling private business.
Resigning office in March 1878, he resumed the practice of law,
and secured the annulment of Garibaldi&rsquo;s marriage. The fall
of Cairoli led to Mancini&rsquo;s appointment (1881) to the ministry
of foreign affairs in the Depretis administration. The growing
desire in Italy for alliance with Austria and Germany did not
at first secure his approval; nevertheless he accompanied King
Humbert to Vienna and conducted the negotiations which led
to the informal acceptance of the Triple Alliance. His desire
to retain French confidence was the chief motive of his refusal
in July 1882 to share in the British expedition to Egypt, but,
finding his efforts fruitless when the existence of the Triple
Alliance came to be known, he veered to the English interest and
obtained assent in London to the Italian expedition to Massawa.
An indiscreet announcement of the limitations of the Triple
Alliance contributed to his fall in June 1885, when he was
succeeded by Count di Robilant. He died in Rome on the
26th of December 1888.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MANCIPLE,<a name="ar54" id="ar54"></a></span> the official title of the caterer at a college, an

The medieval Latin <i>manceps</i>, formed from <i>mancipium</i>, acquisition
by purchase (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Roman Law</a></span>), meant a purchaser of stores,
and <i>mancipium</i> became used of his office. It is from the latter
word that the O. Fr. <i>manciple</i> is taken.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MANCUNIUM,<a name="ar55" id="ar55"></a></span> the name often (though perhaps incorrectly)
given as the Romano-British name of Manchester. Here, close
to the Medlock, in the district still called Castlefield near Knott
Mill, stood in Roman days a fort garrisoned by a cohort of Roman
auxiliary soldiers. The site is now obscured by houses, railways
and the Rochdale canal, but vestiges of Roman ramparts can
still be seen, and other remains were found in 1907 and previous
years. Traces of Romano-British inhabitation have been noted
elsewhere in Manchester, especially near the cathedral. But
there was no town here; we can trace nothing more than a fort
guarding the roads running north through Lancashire and east
into Yorkshire, and the dwellings of women-folk and traders
which would naturally spring up outside such a fort. The
ancient name is unknown. Our Roman authorities give both
Mancunium and Mamucium, but it is not clear that either
form is correct.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MANDAEANS,<a name="ar56" id="ar56"></a></span> also known as Sabians, Nasoraeans, or St
John&rsquo;s Christians,<a name="fa1j" id="fa1j" href="#ft1j"><span class="sp">1</span></a> an Oriental sect of great antiquity, interesting
to the theologian as almost the only surviving example of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page555" id="page555"></a>555</span>
religion compounded of Christian, heathen and Jewish elements
on a type which is essentially that of ancient Gnosticism.</p>

<p>The Mandaeans are found in the marshy lands of South Babylonia
(al-ba&#7789;&#257;i&#7717;), particularly in the neighbourhood of Basra (or
Bussorah), and in Kh&#363;zist&#257;n (Disful, Shuster).<a name="fa2j" id="fa2j" href="#ft2j"><span class="sp">2</span></a> They speak
the languages of the localities in which they are settled (Arabic
or Persian), but the language of their sacred books is an Aramaic
dialect, which has its closest affinities with that of the Babylonian
Talmud, written in a peculiar character suggestive of the old
Palmyrene.<a name="fa3j" id="fa3j" href="#ft3j"><span class="sp">3</span></a> The existence of the Mandaeans has been known
since the middle of the 17th century, when the first Christian
missionaries, Ignatius a Jesu<a name="fa4j" id="fa4j" href="#ft4j"><span class="sp">4</span></a> and Angelus a Sancto, began to
labour among them at Basra; further information was gathered
at a somewhat later date by Pietro della Valle<a name="fa5j" id="fa5j" href="#ft5j"><span class="sp">5</span></a> and Jean de
Thévenot<a name="fa6j" id="fa6j" href="#ft6j"><span class="sp">6</span></a> (1633-1667), and in the following century by Engelbrecht
Kaempfer (1651-1716), Jean Chardin (1643-1713) and
Carsten Niebuhr. In recent times they have been visited by
A. H. Petermann<a name="fa7j" id="fa7j" href="#ft7j"><span class="sp">7</span></a> and Albrecht Socin, and Siouffi<a name="fa8j" id="fa8j" href="#ft8j"><span class="sp">8</span></a> published in
1880 a full and accurate account of their manners and customs,
taken from the lips of a converted Mandaean. For our knowledge
of their doctrinal system, however, we still depend chiefly
upon the sacred books already mentioned, consisting of fragments
of very various antiquity derived from an older literature.<a name="fa9j" id="fa9j" href="#ft9j"><span class="sp">9</span></a>
Of these the largest and most important is the <i>Sidr&#257; rabb&#257;</i>
(&ldquo;Great Book&rdquo;), known also as <i>Ginz&#257;</i> (&ldquo;Treasure&rdquo;), consisting
of two unequal parts, of which the larger is called <i>yam&#299;n&#257;</i> (to the
right hand) and the smaller <i>s&rsquo;mala</i> (to the left hand), because
of the manner in which they are bound together. The former
is intended for the living; the latter consists chiefly of prayers
to be read at the burial of priests. As regards doctrine, the work
is exhaustive; but it is diffuse, obscure, and occasionally self-contradictory,
as might be expected in a work which consists
of a number of unconnected paragraphs of various authorship
and date. The last section of the &ldquo;right-hand&rdquo; part (the &ldquo;Book
of Kings&rdquo;) is one of the older portions, and from its allusion
to &ldquo;the Persian and Arabian kings&rdquo; may be dated somewhere
between <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 700 and 900. Many of the doctrinal portions may
in substance well be still older, and date from the time of the
Sassanids. None of the MSS., however, is older than the 16th
century.<a name="fa10j" id="fa10j" href="#ft10j"><span class="sp">10</span></a></p>

<p>The following sketch represents, as far as can be gathered from
these heterogeneous sources, the principal features of the Mandaean
system. The ground and origin of all things is <i>P&#299;r&#257;</i>, or
more correctly <i>P&#275;r&#257; rabb&#257;</i> (&ldquo;the great abyss,&rdquo; or from <span title="paar">&#1508;&#1506;&#1512;</span>, &ldquo;to
split,&rdquo; cf. the Gnostic <span class="grk" title="buthos">&#946;&#965;&#952;&#972;&#962;</span>, or more probably cf. Heb. <i>per&#299;</i>, &ldquo;the
great fruit&rdquo;), associated with whom, and forming a triad with
him, are the primal aeons <i>Ayar z&#299;v&#257; rabb&#257;</i>, &ldquo;the great shining
aether,&rdquo; and <i>M&#257;n&#257; rabb&#257; d&rsquo;e&#7731;&#257;r&#257;</i>, &ldquo;the great spirit of glory,&rdquo;
usually called simply <i>M&#257;n&#257; rabb&#257;</i>. The last-named, the most
prominent of the three, is the king of light properly so called, from
whom the development of all things begins. From him emanates
<i>Yard&#283;n&#257; rabb&#257;</i>, &ldquo;the great Jordan,&rdquo; which, as the higher-world
soul, permeates the whole aether, the domain of Ayar. Alongside
of <i>M&#257;n&#257; rabb&#257;</i> frequent mention is made of <i>D&rsquo;m&#363;th&#257;</i>, his
&ldquo;image,&rdquo; as a female power; the name &ldquo;image of the father&rdquo;
arises out of the same conception as that which gives rise to the
name of <span class="grk" title="ennoia">&#7956;&#957;&#957;&#959;&#953;&#945;</span> among the Greek Gnostics. <i>M&#257;n&#257; rabb&#257;</i> called
into being the highest of the aeons properly so called, <i>Hayy&#275;
Kadm&#257;y&#275;</i>, &ldquo;Primal Life,&rdquo; and then withdrew into deepest secrecy,
visible indeed to the highest but not to the lowest aeons (cf.
<span class="grk" title="Sophia">&#931;&#959;&#966;&#943;&#945;</span> and <span class="grk" title="Propatôr">&#928;&#961;&#959;&#960;&#940;&#964;&#969;&#961;</span>), yet manifesting himself also to the souls
of the more pious of the Mandaeans after their separation from
the body. Primal Life, who is properly speaking the Mandaean
god, has the same predicates as the primal spirit, and every
prayer, as well as every section of the sacred books, begins by
invoking him.<a name="fa11j" id="fa11j" href="#ft11j"><span class="sp">11</span></a> The extremely fantastic delineation of the world
of light by which <i>Hayy&#275; Kadm&#257;y&#275;</i> is surrounded (see for example
the beginning of <i>Sidr&#257; rabb&#257;</i>) corresponds very closely with the
Manichaean description of the abode of the &ldquo;king of the paradise
of light.&rdquo; The king of light &ldquo;sits in the far north in might and
glory.&rdquo; The Primal Light unfolds himself by five great branches,
viz. &ldquo;the highest purest light, the gentle wind, the harmony
of sounds, the voice of all the aeons, and the beauty of their
forms,&rdquo; all these being treated as abstractions and personified.
Out of the further development and combination of these primary
manifestations arise numerous aeons (<i>&lsquo;Uthr&#275;</i>, &ldquo;splendours,&rdquo; from
<span title="atar">&#1506;&#1514;&#1512;</span>, &ldquo;is rich&rdquo;), of which the number is often stated to be three
hundred and sixty. They are divided into a number of classes
(kings, hypostases, forms, &amp;c.); the proper names by which they
are invoked are many, and for the most part obscure, borrowed
doubtless, to some extent, from the Parsee angelology. From
the First Life proceeds as a principal emanation the &ldquo;Second
Life,&rdquo; <i>Hayy&#275; Tiny&#257;n&#275;</i>, generally called <i>Y&#333;sham&#299;n</i>. This last name
is evidently meant to be Hebrew, &ldquo;Yahweh of the heavens,&rdquo;
the God of the Jews being of a secondary rank in the usual
Gnostic style. The next emanation after <i>Y&#333;sham&#299;n</i> is &ldquo;the
messenger of life&rdquo; (<i>Mand&#257; d&rsquo;hayy&#275;</i>, literally <span class="grk" title="gnôsis tês zôês">&#947;&#957;&#8182;&#963;&#953;&#962; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#950;&#969;&#8134;&#962;</span>),
the most important figure in the entire system, the mediator and
redeemer, the <span class="grk" title="logos">&#955;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962;</span> and the Christ of the Mandaeans, from
whom, as already stated, they take their name. He belongs
to the heathen Gnosis, and is in his essence the same as the
Babylonian Marduk. <i>Y&#333;sham&#299;n</i> desired to raise himself above
the Primal Light, but failed in the attempt, and was punished
by removal out of the pure aetherial world into that of inferior
light. Mand&#257;, on the other hand, continues with the First Life
and <i>M&#257;n&#257; rabb&#257;</i>, and is called his &ldquo;beloved son,&rdquo; the &ldquo;first
born,&rdquo; &ldquo;high priest&rdquo; and &ldquo;word of life.&rdquo; The &ldquo;Life&rdquo; calls into
existence in the visible world a series of three great Helpers,
Hibil, Shithil and An&#333;sh (late Judaeo-Babylonian transformations
of the well-known names of the book of Genesis), the
guardians of souls. The last son of the Second Life is <i>Hayy&#275;
t&rsquo;l&#299;thay&#275;</i>, the &ldquo;Third Life,&rdquo; usually called father of the Uthr&#275;
(<i>Ab&#257; d&lsquo; &lsquo;Uthr&#275;</i>, <i>Ab&#257;th&#363;r</i>). His usual epithet is &ldquo;the Ancient&rdquo;
(<i>&lsquo;A&#7789;&#299;q&#257;</i>), and he is also called &ldquo;the deeply hidden and guarded.&rdquo;
He stands on the borderland between the here and the hereafter,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page556" id="page556"></a>556</span>
like the mysterious <span class="grk" title="preobutês tritos">&#960;&#961;&#949;&#963;&#946;&#973;&#964;&#951;&#962; &#964;&#961;&#943;&#964;&#959;&#962;</span> or <i>senex tertius</i> of Mani,
whose becoming visible will betoken the end of the world.
Ab&#257;th&#363;r sits on the farthest verge of the world of light that lies
towards the lower regions, and weighs in his balance the deeds
of the departed spirits who ascend to him. Beneath him was
originally nothing but a huge void with muddy black water at
the bottom, in which his image was reflected, becoming ultimately
solidified into P&rsquo;t&#257;h&#299;l, his son, who now partakes of the
nature of matter. The demiurge of the Mandaeans, and corresponding
to the Ialdabaoth of the Ophites, he at the instance of
his father frames the earth and men&mdash;according to some passages
in conjunction with the seven bad planetary spirits. He created
Adam and Eve, but was unable to make them stand upright,
whereupon Hibil, Shithil and An&#333;sh were sent by the First Life
to infuse into their forms spirit from <i>M&#257;n&#257; rabb&#257;</i> himself. Hibil,
at the instance of the supreme God, also taught men about the
world of light and the aeons, and especially gave them to know
that not P&rsquo;t&#257;h&#299;l but another was their creator and supreme God,
who as &ldquo;the great king of light, without number, without limit,&rdquo;
stands far above him. At the same time he enjoined the pair
to marry and people the world. P&rsquo;t&#257;h&#299;l had now lost his power
over men, and was driven by his father out of the world of light
into a place beneath it, whence he shall at the day of judgment
be raised, and after receiving baptism be made king of the &lsquo;Uthr&#275;
with divine honours.</p>

<p>The underworld is made up of four vestibules and three hells
properly so called. The vestibules have each two rulers, Zartay
and Zartanay, Hag and Mag, Gaf and Gafan, Anatan and Kin.
In the highest hell rules alone the grisly king Sh&rsquo;d&#363;m, &ldquo;the
warrior&rdquo;; in the storey immediately beneath is Giv, &ldquo;the
great&rdquo;; and in the lowest is Kr&#363;n or Kark&#363;m, the oldest and
most powerful of all, commonly called &ldquo;the great mountain of
flesh&rdquo; (<i>T&#363;r&#257; rabb&#257; d&rsquo;besr&#257;</i>), but also &ldquo;the first-born of darkness.&rdquo;
In the vestibules dirty water is still to be met with, but the hells
are full of scorching consuming fire, except Kr&#363;n&rsquo;s domain, where
is nought but dust, ashes and vacancy. Into these regions
descended Hibil the brilliant, in the power of <i>M&#257;n&#257; rabb&#257;</i>, just
as in the Manichaean mythology the &ldquo;primal man,&rdquo; armed with
the elements of the king of light, descends to a contest with the
primal devil. Hibil lingers, gradually unfolding his power, in
each of the vestibules, and finally passing from hell to hell reaches
Kark&#363;m. Hibil allows himself to be half swallowed by the
monster, but is unhurt, and compels his antagonist to recognize
the superiority of <i>M&#257;n&#257; rabb&#257;</i>, the God of light, and to divulge
his profoundest secret, the hidden name of darkness. Armed
with this he returns through the successive hells, compelling the
disclosure of every secret, depriving the rulers of their power,
and barring the doors of the several regions. From the fourth
vestibule he brought the female devil R&#363;h&#257;, daughter of Kin,
and set her over the whole four. This R&#363;h&#257;, the mother of falsehood
and lies, of poisoning and fornication is an anti-Christian
parody of the R&#363;h&#257; d&rsquo;Qudsh&#257; (Holy Spirit) of the Syriac Church.
She is the mother of Ur, the personified fire of hell, who in anger
and pride made a violent onset on the world of light (compare
the similar occurrence in the Manichaean mythology), but was
mastered by Hibil and thrown in chains down to the &ldquo;black
water,&rdquo; and imprisoned within seven iron and seven golden walls.
By Ur, R&#363;h&#257;, while P&rsquo;t&#257;h&#299;l was engaged in his work of creation,
became mother of three sets of seven, twelve and five sons
respectively; all were translated by P&rsquo;t&#257;h&#299;l to the heavenly firmament
(like the Archons of Mani), the first group forming the
planets and the next the signs of the zodiac, while the third is
as yet undetermined. Of the names of the planets Estera (Ishtar
Venus, also called R&#363;h&#257; d&rsquo;Qudsh&#257;, &ldquo;holy spirit&rdquo;), Enba (Nebo,
Mercury), S&#299;n (moon), K&#275;w&#257;n (Saturn), B&#299;l (Jupiter), and Nir&#299;g
(Nirgal, Mars) reveal their Babylonian origin; Il or Il Il, the sun,
is also known as &#7730;&#257;d&#363;sh and Ad&#363;nay (the Adonai of the Old
Testament); as lord of the planetary spirits his place is in the
midst of them; they are the source of all temptation and evil
amongst men. The houses of the planets, as well as the earth
and a second world immediately to the north of it, rest upon
anvils laid by Hibil on the belly of Ur.</p>

<p>In the Mandaean representation the sky is an ocean of
water, pure and clear, but of more than adamantine solidity,
upon which the stars and planets sail. Its transparency
allows us to see even to the pole star, who is the central sun
around whom all the heavenly bodies move. Wearing a jewelled
crown, he stands before Ab&#257;th&#363;r&rsquo;s door at the gate of the world
of light; the Mandaeans accordingly invariably pray with their
faces turned northward. The earth is conceived of as a round
disk, slightly sloping towards the south, surrounded on three
sides by the sea, but on the north by a high mountain of turquoises;
behind this is the abode of the blest, a sort of inferior
paradise, inhabited by the Egyptians who were saved from
drowning with Pharaoh in the Red Sea, and whom the Mandaeans
look upon as their ancestors, Pharaoh himself having been
their first high priest and king. The total duration of the earth
they fix at four hundred and eighty thousand years, divided into
seven epochs, in each of which one of the planets rules. The
<i>Sidr&#257; Rabb&#257;</i> knows of three total destructions of the human race
by fire and water, pestilence and sword, a single pair alone surviving
in each case. In the Mandaean view the Old Testament
saints are false prophets; such as Abraham, who arose six thousand
years after N&#363;(Noah) during the reign of the sun, M&#299;sh&#257; (Moses),
in whose time the true religion was professed by the Egyptians,
and Shl&#299;m&#363;n (Solomon) bar Davith, the lord of the demons.
Another false prophet and magician was Yishu M&rsquo;sh&#299;h&#257;, who was
in fact a manifestation of the planet Mercury. Forty-two years
before his day, under King Pontius Pilate, there had appeared
the true prophet Yahy&#257; or John son of Zechariah, an incarnation
of Hibil, of whose birth and childhood fantastic stories are told.
Yahy&#257; by a mistake gave baptism to the false Messiah, who had
feigned humility; on the completion of his mission, after undergoing
a seeming execution, he returned clothed with light into
the kingdom of light. As a contemporary of Yahy&#257; and the
false Messiah Hibil&rsquo;s younger brother An&#333;sh &lsquo;Uthr&#257; came down
from heaven, caused himself to be baptized by Yahy&#257;, wrought
miracles of healing and of raising the dead, and brought about
the crucifixion of the false Messiah. He preached the true
religion, destroyed Jerusalem (&ldquo;Urashlam,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> &ldquo;the devil
finished it&rdquo;), which had been built by Ad&#363;nay, dispersed over
the world the Jews who had put Yahy&#257; to death, and previous
to his return into the worlds of light sent forth three hundred and
sixty prophets for the diffusion of the true religion. All this
speaks of intense hatred alike of Jews and Christians; the fasts,
celibacy and monastic and anchoret life of the latter are
peculiarly objectionable to the Mandaeans. Two hundred and
forty years after the appearing of the false Messiah there came
to the world sixty thousand saints out of Pharaoh&rsquo;s world to
take the place of the Mandaeans, who had been completely
extirpated; their high priest had his residence in Damascus.
The last false prophet was M&rsquo;hammad or Ahmat bar Bisbat
(Mahomet), but An&#333;sh, who remained close beside him and his
immediate successors, prevented hostilities against the true
believers, who claim to have had in Babylonia, under the
Abbasids, four hundred places of worship. Subsequent persecutions
compelled their withdrawal to &lsquo;Amm&#257;ra in the
neighbourhood of W&#257;sit, and ultimately to Kh&#363;zist&#257;n. At the
end of the world the devil Ur will swallow up the earth and
the other intermediate higher worlds, and thereupon will burst
and fall into the abyss of darkness where, along with all the
worlds and powers of darkness, he will ultimately cease to be, so
that thenceforward the universe will consist of but one everlasting
world of light.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The chief depositaries of these Mandaean mysteries are the priests,
who enjoy a high degree of power and social regard. The priesthood
has three grades: (1) the <i>Sh&rsquo;kand&#257;</i> or deacon is generally
chosen from episcopal or priestly families, and must be without
bodily blemish. The candidate for orders must be at least nineteen
years old and have undergone twelve years&rsquo; preparation; he is then
qualified to assist the priesthood in the ceremonies of religion. (2)
The <i>Tarm&#299;d&#257;</i> (<i>i.e.</i> &ldquo;Talm&#299;d&#257;,&rdquo; &ldquo;initiated&rdquo;) or priest is ordained
by a bishop and two priests or by four priests after a long
and extremely painful period of preparation. (3) The <i>Ganzivr&#257;</i>
(&ldquo;treasurer&rdquo;) or bishop, the highest dignitary, is chosen from
the whole body of the Tarm&#299;d&#257;s after a variety of tests, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page557" id="page557"></a>557</span>
possesses unlimited authority over the clergy. A supreme priestly
rank, that of <i>R&#299;sh &lsquo;amm&#257;</i>, or &ldquo;head of the people,&rdquo; is recognized,
but only in theory; since the time of Pharaoh this sovereign
pontificate has only once been filled. Women are admitted to
priestly offices as well as men. The priestly dress, which is all white,
consists of drawers, an upper garment, and a girdle with the so-called
<i>t&#257;g&#257;</i> (&ldquo;crown&rdquo;); in all ceremonies the celebrants must be barefoot.
By far the most frequent and important of the religious ceremonies
is that of baptism (<i>ma&#7779;b&#363;th&#257;</i>), which is called for in a great variety
of cases, not only for children but for adults, where consecration or
purification is required, as for example on all Sundays and feast
days, after contact with a dead body, after return from abroad,
after neglect of any formality on the part of a priest in the discharge
of his functions. In all these cases baptism is performed by total
immersion in running water, but during the five days&rsquo; baptismal
festival the rite is observed wholesale by mere sprinkling of large
masses of the faithful at once. The Mandaeans observe also with
the elements of bread (<i>peht&#257;</i>) and wine (<i>mamb&#363;h&#257;</i>, lit. &ldquo;fountain&rdquo;)
a sort of eucharist, which has a special sanctifying efficacy, and is
usually dispensed at festivals, but only to baptized persons of good
repute who have never willingly denied the Mandaean faith. In
receiving it the communicant must not touch the host with his
finger; otherwise it loses its virtue. The hosts are made by the
priests from unleavened fine flour. The Mandaean places of worship,
being designed only for the priests and their assistants (the worshippers
remaining in the forecourt), are excessively small, and very
simply furnished; two windows, a door that opens towards the south
so that those who enter have their faces turned towards the pole
star, a few boards in the corner, and a gabled roof complete the whole
structure; there is neither altar nor decoration of any kind. The
neighbourhood of running water (for baptisms) is essential. At the
consecration of a church the sacrifice of a dove (the bird of Ishtar)
has place among the ceremonies. Besides Sundays there are six
great feasts: (1) that of the New Year (<i>Naur&#363;z rabb&#257;</i>), on the first
day of the first month of winter; (2) <i>Dehw&#257; h&rsquo; n&#299;n&#257;</i>, the anniversary
of the happy return of <i>Hibil Z&#299;v&#257;</i> from the kingdom of darkness into
that of light, lasting five days, beginning with the 18th of the first
month of spring; (3) the <i>Marw&#257;n&#257;</i>, in commemoration of the drowned
Egyptians, on the first day of the second month of spring; (4) the
great five days&rsquo; baptismal festival (<i>pantsh&#257;</i>), the chief feast, kept
on the five intercalary days at the end of the second month of summer&mdash;during
its continuance every Mandaean, male and female,
must dress in white and bathe thrice daily; (5) <i>Dehw&#257; d&rsquo;daim&#257;n&#257;</i>,
in honour of one of the three hundred and sixty &lsquo;Uthras, on the first
day of the second month of autumn; (6) <i>Kanshe Zahl&#257;</i>, the preparation
feast, held on the last day of the year. There are also fast days
called m&rsquo;battal (Arab.), on which it is forbidden to kill any living
thing or eat flesh. These, however, are really &ldquo;rest-days,&rdquo; as
fasting is forbidden in Mandaeism. The year is solar, and has
twelve months of thirty days each, with five intercalary days between
the eighth and the ninth month. Of the seven days of the week,
next to Sunday (habshaba) Thursday has a special sacredness as
the day of <i>Hibil Z&#299;v&#257;</i>. As regards secular occupation, the present
Mandaeans are goldsmiths, ironworkers, and house and ship carpenters.
The <i>Sidr&#257; Rabb&#257;</i> lays great stress upon the duty of procreation,
and marriage is a duty. In the 17th century, according to the old
travellers, they numbered about 20,000 families, but at the present
day they hardly number more than 1200 souls. In external appearance
the Mandaean is distinguished from the Moslem only by a brown
coat and a parti-coloured headcloth with a cord twisted round it.
They have some peculiar deathbed rites: a deacon with some attendants
waits upon the dying, and as death approaches administers
a bath first of warm and afterwards of cold water; a holy dress,
consisting of seven pieces (rast&#257;), is then put on; the feet are directed
towards the north and the head turned to the south, so that the body
faces the pole star. After the burial a funeral feast is held in the
house of mourning.</p>

<p>The Mandaeans are strictly reticent about their theological dogmas
in the presence of strangers; and the knowledge they actually
possess of these is extremely small. The foundation of the system
is obviously to be sought in Gnosticism, and more particularly in
the older type of that doctrine (known from the serpent symbol as
Ophite or Naassene) which obtained in Mesopotamia and Further
Asia generally. But it is equally plain that the Ophite nucleus has
from time to time received very numerous and often curiously perverted
accretions from Babylonian Judaism, Oriental Christianity
and Parsism, exhibiting a striking example of religious syncretism.
In the Gnostic basis itself it is not difficult to recognize the general
features of the religion of ancient Babylonia, and thus we are brought
nearer a solution of the problem as to the origin of Gnosticism in
general. It is certain that Babylonia, the seat of the present
Mandaeans, must be regarded also as the cradle in which their
system was reared; it is impossible to think of them as coming from
Palestine, or to attribute to their doctrines a Jewish or Christian
origin. They do not spring historically from the disciples of John
the Baptist (Acts xviii. 25; xix. 3 seq.; <i>Recog. Clem.</i> i. 54); the tradition
in which he and the Jordan figure so largely is not original,
and is therefore worthless; at the same time it is true that their
baptismal praxis and its interpretation place them in the same
religious group with the Hemerobaptists of Eusebius (<i>H. E.</i> iv. 22)
and Epiphanius (<i>Haer.</i>, xvii.), or with the sect of disciples of John
who remained apart from Christianity. Their reverence for John is
of a piece with their whole syncretizing attitude towards the New
Testament. Indeed, as has been seen, they appropriate the entire
personale of the Bible from Adam, Seth, Abel, Enos and Pharaoh
to Jesus and John, a phenomenon which bears witness to the close
relations of the Mandaean doctrine both with Judaism and Christianity&mdash;not
the less close because they were relations of hostility.
The history of religion presents other examples of the degradation
of holy to demonic figures on occasion of religious schism. The use
of the word &ldquo;Jordan,&rdquo; even in the plural, for &ldquo;sacred water,&rdquo; is
precisely similar to that by the Naassenes described in the <i>Philosophumena</i>
(v. 7); there <span class="grk" title="ho megas Iordanês">&#8001; &#956;&#941;&#947;&#945;&#962; &#7992;&#959;&#961;&#948;&#940;&#957;&#951;&#962;</span> denotes the spiritualizing
sanctifying fluid which pervades the world of light. The notions of
the Egyptians and the Red Sea, according to the same work (v. 16),
are used by the Peratae much as by the Mandaeans. And the position
assigned by the Sethians (<span class="grk" title="Sêthianoi">&#931;&#951;&#952;&#953;&#945;&#957;&#959;&#943;</span>) to Seth is precisely similar
to that given by the Mandaeans to Abel. Both alike are merely old
Babylonian divinities in a new Biblical garb. The genesis of Mandaeism
and the older gnosis from the old and elaborate Babylonio-Chaldaean
religion is clearly seen also in the fact that the names of
the old pantheon (as for example those of the planetary divinities)
are retained, but their holders degraded to the position of demons&mdash;a
conclusion confirmed by the fact that the Mandaeans, like the
allied Ophites, Peratae and Manichaeans, certainly have their
original seat in Mesopotamia and Babylonia. It seems clear that
the trinity of Anu, Bel, and Ea in the old Babylonian religion has its
counterpart in the Mandaean P&#299;r&#257;, Ayar, and M&#257;n&#257; rabb&#257;. The
D&rsquo;m&#363;th&#257; of M&#257;n&#257; is the Damkina, the wife of Ea, mentioned by
Damascius as <span class="grk" title="Dankê">&#916;&#945;&#973;&#954;&#951;</span>, wife of <span class="grk" title="Ahos">&#7945;&#972;&#962;</span>. Mand&#257; d&rsquo;hayy&#275; and his image
Hibil Z&#299;v&#257; with his incarnations clearly correspond to the old
Babylonian Marduk, Merodach, the &ldquo;first-born&rdquo; son of Ea, with his
incarnations, the chief divinity of the city of Babylon, the mediator
and redeemer in the old religion. Hibil&rsquo;s contest with darkness has
its prototype in Marduk&rsquo;s battle with chaos, the dragon Tiamat,
which (another striking parallel) partially swallows Marduk, just
as is related of Hibil and the Manichaean primal man. Other
features are borrowed by the Mandaean mythology under this head
from the well-known epos of Istar&rsquo;s <i>descensus ad inferos</i>. The sanctity
with which water is invested by the Mandaeans is to be explained
by the fact that Ea has his seat &ldquo;in the depths of the world sea.&rdquo;</p>

Christian missionaries, who had regard merely to the reverence in
which the name of the Baptist is held among them, and their frequent

Copenhagen, 1815-1816, followed by a lexicon in 1816, and an
onomasticon in 1817), is so defective as to be quite useless; even the

It is also known as <i>Sidr&#257; d&rsquo;neshm&#257;tha</i>, &ldquo;Book of Souls,&rdquo; and besides
hymns and doctrinal discourses contains prayers to be offered by the
priests at sacrifice and at meals, as well as other liturgical matter.
The Mandaean marriage service occurs both in Paris and in Oxford
as an independent MS. The <i>D&#299;w&#257;n</i>, hitherto unpublished, contains
the ritual for atonement. The <i>Asfar malw&#257;sh&#275;</i>, or &ldquo;Book of the

<p><span class="bold">MANDALAY,<a name="ar57" id="ar57"></a></span> formerly the capital of independent Burma,
now the headquarters of the Mandalay division and district, as
well as the chief town in Upper Burma, stands on the left bank
of the Irrawaddy, in 21° 59&prime; N. and 96° 8&prime; E. Its height above
mean sea-level is 315 ft. Mandalay was built in 1856-1857 by
King Mind&#333;n. It is now divided into the municipal area and
the cantonment. The town covers an area of 6 m. from north
to south and 3 from east to west, and has well-metalled
roads lined with avenues of trees and regularly lighted and
watered. The cantonment consists of the area inside the old
city walls, and is now called Fort Dufferin. In the centre stands
the palace, a group of wooden buildings, many of them highly
carved and gilt, resting on a brick platform 900 ft. by 500 ft.,
and 6 ft. high. The greater part of it is now utilized for military
and other offices. The garrison consists of a brigade belonging
to the Burma command of the Indian army. There are many fine
pagodas and monastic buildings in the town. The population
in 1901 was 183,816, showing a decrease of 3% in the decade.
The population is very mixed. Besides Burmese there are
Zerbadis (the offspring of a Mahommedan with a Burman wife),
Mahommedans, Hindus, Jews, Chinese, Shans and Manipuris
(called Kathe), Kachins and Palaungs. Trains run from Mandalay
to Rangoon, Myit-kyina, and up the Mandalay-Kunlong railway.
The steamers of the Irrawaddy Flotilla Company also ply
in all directions. There are twenty bazaars, the chief of which,
the Zegyo, was burnt in 1897, and again in 1906, but rebuilt.</p>

<p>The <span class="sc">Mandalay District</span> has an area of 2117 sq. m. and a population
(1901) of 366,507, giving a density of 177 inhabitants to the
square mile. About 600 sq. m. along the Irrawaddy river are
flat land, nearly all cultivated. In the north and east there are
some 1500 sq. m. of high hills and table-lands, forming geographically
a portion of the Shan table-land. Here the fall to the
plains averages 3000 to 4000 ft. in a distance of 10 m. This part
of the district is well wooded and watered. The Maymyo
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page558" id="page558"></a>558</span>
subdivision has very fine plateaus of 3000 to 3600 ft. in height.
The highest peaks are between 4000 and 5000 ft. above sea-level.
The Irrawaddy, the Myit-ngè and the Madaya are the
chief rivers. The last two come from the Shan States, and are
navigable for between 20 and 30 m. There are many canals,
most of which have fallen greatly into disrepair, and the
Aungbinle, Nanda and Shwepyi lakes also supply water for
cultivation. A systematic irrigation scheme has been undertaken
by the government. The Sagyin hills near Madaya are
noted for their alabaster; rubies are also found in small quantities.
There are 335 sq. m. of forest reserves in the district, but there
is little teak. The climate is dry and healthy. During May and
June and till August strong winds prevail. The thermometer
rises to about 107° in the shade in the hot weather, and the
minimum in the month of December is about 55°. The rainfall
is light, the average being under 30 in.</p>

<p>The <span class="sc">Division</span> includes the districts of Mandalay, Bhamo,
Myit-kyina, Katha and Ruby Mines, with a total area of 29,373
sq. m., and a population (1901) of 777,338, giving an average
density of 30 inhabitants to the square mile.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MANDAMUS, WRIT OF,<a name="ar58" id="ar58"></a></span> in English law, a high prerogative
writ issuing from the High Court of Justice (named from the first
word in the Latin form of the writ) containing a command in the
name of the king, directed to inferior courts, corporations, or
individuals, ordering them to do a specific act within the duty of
their office, or which they are bound by statute to do, and performance
whereof the applicant for the writ has a specific legal
right to enforce. Direct orders from the sovereign to subjects
commanding the performance of particular acts were common in
early times, and to this class of orders <i>mandamus</i> originally
belonged. It became customary for the court of king&rsquo;s bench, in
cases where a legal duty was established but no sufficient means
existed for enforcing it, to order performance by this writ.
Under the Judicature Acts and the <i>Crown Office Rules</i>, 1906
(r. 49), the powers of the court of king&rsquo;s bench as to the grant
of the prerogative writ of mandamus are exercisable only in the
king&rsquo;s bench division of the High Court.</p>

<p>The writ though of right is not of course: <i>i.e.</i> the applicant
cannot have it merely for the asking, but must satisfy the High
Court that circumstances exist calling for its issue. The procedure
regulating the grant and enforcement of the writ is
determined by the <i>Crown Office Rules</i>, 1906 (rr. 49-68, 125).</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Mandamus</i> has always been regarded as an exceptional remedy
to supplement the deficiencies of the common law, or defects of
justice. Where another legal or equitable remedy exists, equally
appropriate, convenient, speedy, beneficial and effectual, the writ
will as a rule be refused. It is occasionally granted even when a
remedy by indictment is available: but is not issued unless the existence
of the duty and refusal to perform it are clearly established,
nor where performance in fact has become impossible. The writ is
used to compel inferior courts to hear and determine according to
law cases within their jurisdiction, <i>e.g.</i> where a county court or
justices in petty or quarter sessions refuse to assume a jurisdiction
which they possess to deal with a matter brought before them.
It has in recent years been employed to compel municipal bodies to
discharge their duties as to providing proper sewerage for their
districts and to compel anti-vaccinationist guardians of the poor
to appoint officers for the execution of the Vaccination Acts; and
it is also employed to compel the promoters of railway and similar
undertakings to discharge duties imposed upon them towards the
public by their special acts, <i>e.g.</i> with reference to highways, &amp;c.,
affected by their railways or other undertakings. The courts do
not prescribe the specific manner in which the duty is to be discharged,
but do not stay their hands until substantial compliance is
established.</p>

<p>Besides the prerogative common-law writ there are a number of
orders, made by the High Court under statutory authority, and described
as or as being in the nature of mandamus, <i>e.g.</i> mandamus to
proceed to the election of a corporate officer of a municipal corporation
(Municipal Corporations Act 1882, s. 225); orders in the nature
of mandamus to justices to hear and determine a matter within their
jurisdiction, or to state and sign a case under the enactments relating
to special cases.</p>

<p>At common law mandamus lies only for the performance of acts
of a public or official character. The enforcement of merely private
obligations, such as those arising from contracts, is not within its
scope. By s. 68 of the Common Law Procedure Act 1854, the plaintiff
in any action other than replevin and ejectment was empowered
to claim a writ of mandamus to compel the defendant to fulfil any
duty in the fulfilment of which the plaintiff was personally interested.
By s. 25 (8) of the Judicature Act 1873 a mandamus may be granted
by an interlocutory order of the High Court in all cases in which it
shall appear to the court just or convenient that such an order should
be made. This enactment does not deal with the prerogative mandamus
but empowers the king&rsquo;s bench and the chancery divisions
to grant an interlocutory mandamus in any pending cause or matter
by an order other than the final judgment and even by an order made
after the judgment. S. 68 of the act of 1854 has been repealed and replaced
by Order LIII. of the <i>Rules of the Supreme Court</i>. The remedy
thus created is an attempt to engraft upon the old common law
remedy by damages a right in the nature of specific performance of
the duty in question. It is not limited to cases in which the prerogative
writ would be granted; but mandamus is not granted when the
result desired can be obtained by some remedy equally convenient,
beneficial and effective, or a particular and different remedy is
provided by statute. An action for mandamus does not lie against
judicial officers such as justices. The mandamus issued in the action
is no longer a writ of mandamus, but a judgment or order having
effect equivalent to the writ formerly used.</p>

<p><i>Mandatory Injunction.</i>&mdash;The High Court has a jurisdiction derived
from the court of chancery to grant injunctions at the suit of the
attorney-general or of private persons. Ordinarily these injunctions
are in the form of prohibition or restraint and not of command. But
occasionally mandatory injunctions are granted in the form of a
direct command by the court.</p>

<p><i>Specific Performance.</i>&mdash;The jurisdiction of the High Court, derived
from the court of chancery, to decree specific performance of contracts
has some resemblance to mandamus in the domains of public
or quasi-public law.</p>

<p><i>Ireland.</i>&mdash;The law of Ireland as to mandamus is derived from that
of England, and differs therefrom only in minor details.</p>

<p><i>British Possessions.</i>&mdash;In a British possession the power to issue
the prerogative writ is usually vested in the Supreme Court by its
charter or by local legislation.</p>

<p><i>United States.</i>&mdash;The writ has passed into the law of the United
States. &ldquo;There is in the federal judiciary an employment of the
writ substantially as the old prerogative writ in the king&rsquo;s bench
practice, also as a mode of exercising appellate jurisdiction, also as a
proceeding ancillary to a judgment previously rendered, in exercise
of original jurisdiction, as when a circuit court having rendered
a judgment against a county issues a mandamus requiring its officers
to levy a tax to provide for the payment of the judgment.&rdquo; And in
the various states mandamus is used under varying regulations,
mandate being in some cases substituted as the name of the
proceeding.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MANDAN,<a name="ar59" id="ar59"></a></span> a tribe of North American Indians of Siouan
stock. When first met they were living on the Missouri at the
mouth of the Heart river. At the beginning of the 19th century
they were driven up the Missouri by the Sioux. In 1845
they joined the Gros Ventres and later the Arikaras, and
settled in their present position at Fort Berthold reservation,
North Dakota. The Mandans have always been agricultural;
they are noted for their ceremonies, and from the tattooing on
face and breast were described in the sign language as &ldquo;the
tattooed people.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="bold">MANDARIN,<a name="ar60" id="ar60"></a></span> the common name for all public officials in
China, the Chinese name for whom is <i>kwan</i> or <i>kw&#363;n</i>. The word
comes through the Portuguese from Malay <i>mantri</i>, a counsellor
or minister of state. The ultimate origin of this word is the
Sanskrit root <i>man-</i>, meaning to &ldquo;think,&rdquo; seen in &ldquo;man,&rdquo;
&ldquo;mind,&rdquo; &amp;c. The term &ldquo;mandarin&rdquo; is not, in its western
usage, applied indiscriminately to all civil and military officials,
but only to those who are entitled to wear a &ldquo;button,&rdquo; which is
a spherical knob, about an inch in diameter, affixed to the top
of the official cap or hat. These officials, civil and military
alike, are divided into nine grades or classes, each grade being
distinguished by a button of a particular colour. The grade to
which an official belongs is not necessarily related to the office
he holds. The button which distinguishes the first grade is
a transparent red stone; the second grade, a red coral button;
the third, a sapphire; the fourth, a blue opaque stone; the fifth,
a crystal button; the sixth, an opaque white shell button; the
seventh, a plain gold button; the eighth, a worked gold button;
and the ninth, a worked silver button. The mandarins also
wear certain insignia embroidered on their official robes, and have
girdle clasps of different material. The first grade have, for
civilians an embroidered Manchurian crane on the breast and
back, for the military an embroidered unicorn with a girdle
clasp of jade set in rubies. The second grade, for civilians an
embroidered golden pheasant, for the military a lion with a girdle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page559" id="page559"></a>559</span>
clasp of gold set in rubies. The third grade, for civilians a peacock,
for the military a leopard with a clasp of worked gold.
The fourth grade, for civilians a wild goose, for the military a
tiger, and a clasp of worked gold with a silver button. The
fifth grade, for civilians a silver pheasant, for the military a
bear and a clasp of plain gold with a silver button. The sixth
grade, for civilians an egret, for the military a tiger-cat with
a mother-of-pearl clasp. The seventh grade, for civilians a
mandarin duck, for the military a mottled bear with a silver
clasp. The eighth grade, for civilians a quail, for the military
a seal with a clear horn clasp. The ninth grade, for civilians a
long-tailed jay, for the military a rhinoceros with a buffalo-horn
clasp.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;mandarin language&rdquo; is the Chinese, which is spoken
in official and legal circles; it is also spoken over a considerable
portion of the country, particularly the northern and central
parts, though not perhaps with the same purity. Mandarin
duck (<i>anas galericulata</i>) and Mandarin orange (<i>citrus nobilis</i>)
possibly derive their names, by analogy, from the sense of
superiority implied in the title &ldquo;mandarin.&rdquo;</p>

It is a centre of the Malwa opium trade.</p>

<p>Mandasor and its neighbourhood are full of archaeological
interest. An inscription discovered near the town indicated
the erection of a temple of the sun in 437, and at Sondani are

<p><span class="bold">MANDATE<a name="ar62" id="ar62"></a></span> (<i>Mandatum</i>), a contract in Roman law constituted
by one person (the <i>mandatarius</i>) promising to do something
gratuitously at the request of another (the <i>mandator</i>), who undertakes
to indemnify him against loss. The jurist distinguished
the different cases of mandatum according as the object of
the contract was the benefit of the mandator or a third person
singly, or the mandator and a third person, the mandator
and the mandatarius, or the mandatarius and a third person
together. When the benefit was that of the mandatarius
alone, the obligations of the contract were held not to arise,
although the form of the contract might exist, the commission
being held to be merely advice tendered to the mandatarius, and
acted on by him at his own risk. Mandatum was classified as
one of the contracts established by consent of the parties alone;
but, as there was really no obligation of any kind until the mandatarius
had acted on the mandate, it has with more propriety
been referred to the contracts created by the supply of some
fact (<i>re</i>). The obligations of the mandatarius under the contract
were, briefly, to do what he had promised according to his
instructions, observing ordinary diligence in taking care of any
property entrusted to him, and handing over to his principal
the results of his action, including the right to sue in his name.
On the other hand, the principal was bound to recoup him his
expenses and indemnify him against loss through obligations he
might have incurred.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The essentials and the terminology of the contract are preserved
in most modern systems of law. But in English law mandate,
under that name, can hardly be said to exist as a separate form of
contract. To some extent the law of mandatum corresponds partly
to the law of principal and agent, partly to that of principal and
surety. &ldquo;Mandate&rdquo; is retained to signify the contract more generally
known as gratuitous bailment. It is restricted to personal
property, and it implies the delivery of something to the bailee,
both of which conditions are unknown in the mandatum of the civil
law (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Bailment</a></span>).</p>

asymmetric carbon atom, the acid exists in three forms, one
being an inactive &ldquo;racemic&rdquo; mixture, and the other two being
optically active forms. The inactive variety is known as
<i>paramandelic acid</i>. It may be prepared by the action of hydrochloric
acid on the addition compound of benzaldehyde and
hydrocyanic acid:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">C<span class="su">6</span>H<span class="su">5</span>CHO + HCN + HCl + 2H<span class="su">2</span>O = C<span class="su">6</span>H<span class="su">5</span>·CHOH·COOH + NH<span class="su">4</span>Cl,</p>

acid with alkalis (A. Spiegel, <i>Ber.</i>, 1881, 14, 239), by heating
benzoylformaldehyde with alkalis (H. v. Pechmann, <i>Ber.</i>, 1887,

<p>It crystallizes from water in large rhombic crystals, which melt
at 118° C. Oxidizing agents convert it into benzaldehyde.
When heated with hydriodic acid and phosphorus it forms
phenylacetic acid; whilst concentrated hydrobromic acid and
hydrochloric acid at moderate temperatures convert it into
phenylbrom- and phenylchlor-acetic acids. The inactive mixture
may be resolved into its active components by fractional
crystallization of the cinchonine salt, when the salt of the <i>dextro</i>
modification separates first; or the ammonium salt may be
fermented by <i>Penicillium glaucum</i>, when the <i>laevo</i> form is
destroyed and the <i>dextro</i> form remains untouched; on the other
hand, <i>Saccharomyces ellipsoïdeus</i> destroys the <i>dextro</i> form, but
does not touch the <i>laevo</i> form. A mixture of the two forms in
equivalent quantities produces the inactive variety, which is
also obtained when either form is heated for some hours to
160° C.</p>

Vlerick at Kortryck. The next five years he devoted to the
writing of religious plays for which he also painted the scenery.
Then followed three years in Rome (1574-1577), where he is said
to have been the first to discover the catacombs. On his return
journey he passed through Vienna, where, together with the
sculptor Hans Mont, he made the triumphal arch for the entry
of the emperor Rudolph. After many vicissitudes caused by
war, loss of fortune and plague, he settled at Haarlem where,
in conjunction with Goltzius and Cornelisz, he founded a successful
academy of painting. His fame is, however, principally
based upon a voluminous biographical work on the paintings
of various epochs&mdash;a book that has become for the northern
countries what Vasari&rsquo;s <i>Lives of the Painters</i> became for Italy.

<i>De chylosi vitiata</i>. Afterwards he came to England &ldquo;to learn
the language,&rdquo; and succeeded so remarkably that many refused
to believe he was a foreigner. As a physician he seems to have
done little, and lived poorly on a pension given him by some
Dutch merchants and money which he earned from distillers
for advocating the use of spirits. His conversational abilities
won him the friendship of Lord Macclesfield (chief justice 1710-1718)
who introduced him to Addison, described by Mandeville
as &ldquo;a parson in a tye-wig.&rdquo; He died in January (19th or 21st)
1733/4 at Hackney.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page560" id="page560"></a>560</span></p>

<p>The work by which he is known is the <i>Fable of the Bees</i>, published
first in 1705 under the title of <i>The Grumbling Hive, or
Knaves Turn&rsquo;d Honest</i> (two hundred doggerel couplets). In 1714
it was republished anonymously with <i>Remarks</i> and <i>An Enquiry
into the Origin of Moral Virtue</i>. In 1723 a later edition appeared,
including <i>An Essay on Charity and Charity Schools</i>, and <i>A Search
into the Nature of Society</i>. The book was primarily written as a
political satire on the state of England in 1705, when the Tories
were accusing Marlborough and the ministry of advocating the
French War for personal reasons. The edition of 1723 was
presented as a nuisance by the Grand Jury of Middlesex, was
denounced in the <i>London Journal</i> by &ldquo;Theophilus Philo-Britannus,&rdquo;
and attacked by many writers, notably by Archibald
Campbell (1691-1756) in his <i>Aretelogia</i> (published as his own by
Alexander Innes in 1728; afterwards by Campbell, under his
own name, in 1733, as <i>Enquiry into the Original of Moral Virtue</i>).
The <i>Fable</i> was reprinted in 1729, a ninth edition appeared in
1755, and it has often been reprinted in more recent times.
Berkeley attacked it in the second dialogue of the <i>Alciphron</i>
(1732) and John Brown criticized him in his <i>Essay upon
Shaftesbury&rsquo;s Characteristics</i> (1751).</p>

<p>Mandeville&rsquo;s philosophy gave great offence at the time, and
has always been stigmatized as false, cynical and degrading.
His main thesis is that the actions of men cannot be divided into
lower and higher. The higher life of man is merely a fiction
introduced by philosophers and rulers to simplify government
and the relations of society. In fact, virtue (which he defined as
&ldquo;every performance by which man, contrary to the impulse
of nature, should endeavour the benefit of others, or the conquest
of his own passions, out of a rational ambition of being good&rdquo;)
is actually detrimental to the state in its commercial and intellectual
progress, for it is the vices (<i>i.e.</i> the self-regarding actions
of men) which alone, by means of inventions and the circulation
of capital in connexion with luxurious living, stimulate society
into action and progress. In the <i>Fable</i> he shows a society
possessed of all the virtues &ldquo;blest with content and honesty,&rdquo;
falling into apathy and utterly paralyzed. The absence of self-love
(cf. Hobbes) is the death of progress. The so-called higher
virtues are mere hypocrisy, and arise from the selfish desire to be
superior to the brutes. &ldquo;The moral virtues are the political
offspring which flattery begot upon pride.&rdquo; Similarly he arrives
at the great paradox that &ldquo;private vices are public benefits.&rdquo;
But his best work and that in which he approximates most nearly
to modern views is his account of the origin of society. His
<i>a priori</i> theories should be compared with Maine&rsquo;s historical
inquiries (<i>Ancient Law</i>, c. V.). He endeavours to show that all
social laws are the crystallized results of selfish aggrandizement
and protective alliances among the weak. Denying any form of
moral sense or conscience, he regards all the social virtues as
evolved from the instinct for self-preservation, the give-and-take
arrangements between the partners in a defensive and offensive
alliance, and the feelings of pride and vanity artificially fed by
politicians, as an antidote to dissension and chaos. Mandeville&rsquo;s
ironical paradoxes are interesting mainly as a criticism of the
&ldquo;amiable&rdquo; idealism of Shaftesbury, and in comparison with the
serious egoistic systems of Hobbes and Helvetius. It is mere
prejudice to deny that Mandeville had considerable philosophic
insight; at the same time he was mainly negative or critical, and,
as he himself said, he was writing for &ldquo;the entertainment of
people of knowledge and education.&rdquo; He may be said to have
cleared the ground for the coming utilitarianism.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MANDEVILLE, GEOFFREY DE<a name="ar67" id="ar67"></a></span> (d. 1144), earl of Essex,
succeeded his father, William, as constable of the Tower of
London in or shortly before 1130. Though a great Essex landowner,
he played no conspicuous part in history till 1140, when
Stephen created him earl of Essex in reward for his services
against the empress Matilda. After the defeat and capture of
Stephen at Lincoln (1141) the earl deserted to Matilda, but before
the end of the year, learning that Stephen&rsquo;s release was imminent,
returned to his original allegiance. In 1142 he was again intriguing
with the empress; but before he could openly join her
cause he was detected and deprived of his castles by the king.
In 1143-1144 Geoffrey maintained himself as a rebel and a bandit
in the fen-country, using the Isle of Ely and Ramsey Abbey as
his headquarters. He was besieged by Stephen in the fens,
and met his death in September 1144 in consequence of a wound
received in a skirmish. His career is interesting for two reasons.
The charters which he extorted from Stephen and Matilda
illustrate the peculiar form taken by the ambitions of English
feudatories. The most important concessions are grants of
offices and jurisdictions which had the effect of making Mandeville
a viceroy with full powers in Essex, Middlesex and
London, and Hertfordshire. His career as an outlaw exemplifies
the worst excesses of the anarchy which prevailed in some parts
of England during the civil wars of 1140-1147, and it is probable
that the deeds of Mandeville inspired the rhetorical description,
in the Peterborough Chronicle of this period, when &ldquo;men said
openly that Christ and his saints were asleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="bold">MANDEVILLE, JEHAN DE<a name="ar68" id="ar68"></a></span> (&ldquo;Sir John Mandeville&rdquo;), the
name claimed by the compiler of a singular book of travels,
written in French, and published between 1357 and 1371. By
aid of translations into many other languages it acquired
extraordinary popularity, while a few interpolated words in a
particular edition of an English version gained for Mandeville
in modern times the spurious credit of being &ldquo;the father of
English prose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In his preface the compiler calls himself a knight, and states
that he was born and bred in England, of the town of St Albans;
had crossed the sea on Michaelmas Day 1322; had travelled by
way of Turkey (Asia Minor), Armenia the little (Cilicia) and the
great, Tartary, Persia, Syria, Arabia, Egypt upper and lower,
Libya, great part of Ethiopia, Chaldaea, Amazonia, India the
less, the greater and the middle, and many countries about
India; had often been to Jerusalem, and had written in Romance
as more generally understood than Latin. In the body of the
work we hear that he had been at Paris and Constantinople;
had served the sultan of Egypt a long time in his wars against
the Bedawin, had been vainly offered by him a princely marriage
and a great estate on condition of renouncing Christianity, and
had left Egypt under sultan Melech Madabron, <i>i.e.</i> Muzaffar
or Mudhaffar<a name="fa1k" id="fa1k" href="#ft1k"><span class="sp">1</span></a> (who reigned in 1346-1347); had been at Mount
Sinai, and had visited the Holy Land with letters under the great
seal of the sultan, which gave him extraordinary facilities; had
been in Russia, Livonia, Cracow, Lithuania, &ldquo;en roialme daresten&rdquo;
(? de Daresten or Silistria), and many other parts near
Tartary, but not in Tartary itself; had drunk of the well of
youth at Polombe (Quilon on the Malabar coast), and still seemed
to feel the better; had taken astronomical observations on the
way to Lamory (Sumatra), as well as in Brabant, Germany,
Bohemia and still farther north; had been at an isle called
Pathen in the Indian Ocean; had been at Cansay (Hangchow-fu)
in China, and had served the emperor of China fifteen months
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page561" id="page561"></a>561</span>
against the king of Manzi; had been among rocks of adamant in
the Indian Ocean; had been through a haunted valley, which he
places near &ldquo;Milstorak&rdquo; (<i>i.e.</i> Malasgird in Armenia); had been
driven home against his will in 1357 by arthritic gout; and had
written his book as a consolation for his &ldquo;wretched rest.&rdquo;
The paragraph which states that he had had his book confirmed
at Rome by the pope is an interpolation of the English
version.</p>

<p>Part at least of the personal history of Mandeville is mere
invention. Nor is any contemporary corroboration of the existence
of such a Jehan de Mandeville known. Some French MSS.,
not contemporary, give a Latin letter of presentation from him
to Edward III., but so vague that it might have been penned by
any writer on any subject. It is in fact beyond reasonable doubt
that the travels were in large part compiled by a Liége physician,
known as Johains à le Barbe or Jehan à la Barbe, otherwise
Jehan de Bourgogne.</p>

<p>The evidence of this is in a modernized extract quoted by the
Liége herald, Louis Abry<a name="fa2k" id="fa2k" href="#ft2k"><span class="sp">2</span></a> (1643-1720), from the lost fourth book
of the <i>Myreur des Hystors</i> of Johans des Preis, styled d&rsquo;Oultremouse.
In this &ldquo;Jean de Bourgogne, dit à la Barbe,&rdquo; is said to
have revealed himself on his deathbed to d&rsquo;Oultremouse, whom
he made his executor, and to have described himself in his will
as &ldquo;messire Jean de Mandeville, chevalier, comte de Montfort
en Angleterre et seigneur de l&rsquo;isle de Campdi et du château
Pérouse.&rdquo; It is added that, having had the misfortune to kill
an unnamed count in his own country, he engaged himself to
travel through the three parts of the world, arrived at Liége in
1343, was a great naturalist, profound philosopher and astrologer,
and had a remarkable knowledge of physic. And the identification
is confirmed by the fact that in the now destroyed church
of the Guillelmins was a tombstone of Mandeville, with a Latin
inscription stating that he was otherwise named &ldquo;ad Barbam,&rdquo;
was a professor of medicine, and died at Liége on the 17th
of November 1372: this inscription is quoted as far back as
1462.</p>

<p>Even before his death the Liége physician seems to have confessed
to a share in the composition of the work. In the common
Latin abridged version of it, at the end of c. vii., the author
says that when stopping in the sultan&rsquo;s court at Cairo he met a
venerable and expert physician of &ldquo;our&rdquo; parts, that they rarely
came into conversation because their duties were of a different
kind, but that long afterwards at Liége he composed this treatise
at the exhortation and with the help (<i>hortatu et adiutorio</i>) of the
same venerable man, as he will narrate at the end of it. And
in the last chapter he says that in 1355, in returning home, he
came to Liége, and being laid up with old age and arthritic
gout in the street called Bassesauenyr, <i>i.e.</i> Basse Savenir, consulted
the physicians. That one came in who was more venerable
than the others by reason of his age and white hairs, was evidently
expert in his art, and was commonly called Magister Iohannes ad
Barbam. That a chance remark of the latter caused the renewal
of their old Cairo acquaintance, and that Ad Barbam, after
showing his medical skill on Mandeville, urgently begged him
to write his travels; &ldquo;and so at length, by his advice and help,
<i>monitu et adiutorio</i>, was composed this treatise, of which I had
certainly proposed to write nothing until at least I had reached
my own parts in England.&rdquo; He goes on to speak of himself as
being now lodged in Liége, &ldquo;which is only two days distant from
the sea of England&rdquo;; and it is stated in the colophon (and in the
MSS.) that the book was first published in French by Mandeville,
its author, in 1355, at Liége, and soon after in the same city
translated into &ldquo;the said&rdquo; Latin form. Moreover, a MS. of the
French text extant at Liége about 1860<a name="fa3k" id="fa3k" href="#ft3k"><span class="sp">3</span></a> contained a similar
statement, and added that the author lodged at a hostel called
&ldquo;al hoste Henkin Levo&rdquo;: this MS. gave the physician&rsquo;s name as
&ldquo;Johains de Bourgogne dit ale barbe,&rdquo; which doubtless conveys
its local form.</p>

<p>There is no contemporary English mention of any English
knight named Jehan de Mandeville, nor are the arms said
to have been on the Liége tomb like any known Mandeville
arms. But Dr G. F. Warner has ingeniously suggested that
de Bourgogne may be a certain Johan de Bourgoyne, who
was pardoned by parliament on the 20th of August 1321
for having taken part in the attack on the Despensers, but
whose pardon was revoked in May 1322, the year in which
&ldquo;Mandeville&rdquo; professes to have left England. And it should
now be added that among the persons similarly pardoned
<i>on the recommendation of the same nobleman</i> was a Joh<span class="sp">a</span>n
Mangevilayn, whose name appears closely related to that of
&ldquo;de Mandeville&rdquo;<a name="fa4k" id="fa4k" href="#ft4k"><span class="sp">4</span></a>&mdash;which is merely a later form of &ldquo;de
Magneville.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mangeuilain occurs in Yorkshire as early as 16 Hen. I. (<i>Pipe
Roll Soc.</i>, xv. 40), but is very rare, and (failing evidence of any
place named Mangeville) seems to be merely a variant spelling
of Magnevillain. The meaning may be simply &ldquo;of Magneville,&rdquo;
<i>de</i> Magneville; but the family of a 14th century bishop of Nevers
were called both &ldquo;Mandevilain&rdquo; and &ldquo;de Mandevilain&rdquo;&mdash;where
Mandevilain seems a derivative place-name, meaning the
Magneville or Mandeville district. In any case it is clear that
the name &ldquo;de Mandeville&rdquo; might be suggested to de Bourgogne
by that of his fellow-culprit Mangevilayn, and it is even possible
that the two fled to England together, were in Egypt together,
met again at Liége, and shared in the compilation of the
<i>Travels</i>.</p>

<p>Whether after the appearance of the <i>Travels</i> either de Bourgogne
or &ldquo;Mangevilayn&rdquo; visited England is very doubtful. St
Albans Abbey had a sapphire ring, and Canterbury a crystal orb,
said to have been given by Mandeville; but these might have
been sent from Liége, and it will appear later that the Liége
physician possessed and wrote about precious stones. St Albans
also had a legend that a ruined marble tomb of Mandeville
(represented cross-legged and in armour, with sword and shield)
once stood in the abbey; this may be true of &ldquo;Mangevilayn&rdquo;
or it may be a mere myth.</p>

<p>It is a little curious that the name preceding Mangevilayn in
the list of persons pardoned is &ldquo;Johan le Barber.&rdquo; Did this
suggest to de Bourgogne the <i>alias</i> &ldquo;à le Barbe,&rdquo; or was that only
a Liége nickname? Note also that the arms on Mandeville&rsquo;s
tomb were borne by the Tyrrells of Hertfordshire (the county in
which St Albans lies); for of course the crescent on the lion&rsquo;s
breast is only the &ldquo;difference&rdquo; indicating a second son.</p>

<p>Leaving this question, there remains the equally complex one
whether the book contains any facts and knowledge acquired
by actual travels and residence in the East. Possibly it may,
but only as a small portion of the section which treats of the
Holy Land and the ways of getting thither, of Egypt, and in
general of the Levant. The prologue, indeed, points almost
exclusively to the Holy Land as the subject of the work. The
mention of more distant regions comes in only towards the end
of this prologue, and (in a manner) as an afterthought.</p>

<p>By far the greater part of these more distant travels, extending
in fact from Trebizond to Hormuz, India, the Malay Archipelago,
and China, and back again to western Asia, has been appropriated
from the narrative of Friar Odoric (written in 1330). These
passages, as served up by Mandeville, are almost always, indeed,
swollen with interpolated particulars, usually of an extravagant
kind, whilst in no few cases the writer has failed to understand the
passages which he adopts from Odoric and professes to give as his
own experiences. Thus (p. 209),<a name="fa5k" id="fa5k" href="#ft5k"><span class="sp">5</span></a> where Odoric has given a most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page562" id="page562"></a>562</span>
curious and veracious account of the Chinese custom of employing
tame cormorants to catch fish, the cormorants are converted
by Mandeville into &ldquo;little beasts called <i>loyres</i> (<i>layre</i>, B), which
are taught to go into the water&rdquo; (the word <i>loyre</i> being apparently
used here for &ldquo;otter,&rdquo; <i>lutra</i>, for which the Provençal is <i>luria</i> or
<i>loiria</i>).</p>

<p>At a very early date the coincidence of Mandeville&rsquo;s stories
with those of Odoric was recognized, insomuch that a MS. of
Odoric which is or was in the chapter library at Mainz begins
with the words: <i>Incipit Itinerarius fidelis fratris Odorici socii
Militis Mendavil per Indian; licet hic</i> [read <i>ille</i>] <i>prius el alter
posterius peregrinationem suam descripsit.</i> At a later day Sir T.
Herbert calls Odoric &ldquo;travelling companion of our Sir John&rdquo;;
and Purchas, with most perverse injustice, whilst calling Mandeville,
next to Polo, &ldquo;if next ... the greatest Asian traveller
that ever the world had,&rdquo; insinuates that Odoric&rsquo;s story was
stolen from Mandeville&rsquo;s. Mandeville himself is crafty enough,
at least in one passage, to anticipate criticism by suggesting
the probability of his having travelled with Odoric (see p. 282
and below).</p>

<p>Much, again, of Mandeville&rsquo;s matter, particularly in Asiatic
geography and history, is taken bodily from the <i>Historiae
Orientis</i> of Hetoum, an Armenian of princely family, who became
a monk of the Praemonstrant order, and in 1307 dictated this
work on the East, in the French tongue at Poitiers, out of his
own extraordinary acquaintance with Asia and its history in his
own time.</p>

<p>It is curious that no passage in Mandeville can be plausibly
traced to Marco Polo, with one exception. This is (p. 163) where
he states that at Hormuz the people during the great heat lie in
water&mdash;a circumstance mentioned by Polo, though not by
Odoric. We should suppose it most likely that this fact had been
interpolated in the copy of Odoric used by Mandeville, for if
he had borrowed it direct from Polo he would have borrowed
more.</p>

<p>A good deal about the manners and customs of the Tatars is
demonstrably derived from the famous work of the Franciscan
Ioannes de Plano Carpini, who went as the pope&rsquo;s ambassador
to the Tatars in 1245-1247; but Dr Warner considers that the
immediate source for Mandeville was the <i>Speculum historiale</i> of
Vincent de Beauvais. Though the passages in question are all
to be found in Plano Carpini more or less exactly, the expression
is condensed and the order changed. For examples compare
Mandeville, p. 250, on the tasks done by Tatar women, with
Plano Carpini, p. 643;<a name="fa6k" id="fa6k" href="#ft6k"><span class="sp">6</span></a> Mandeville, p. 250, on Tatar habits of
eating, with Plano Carpini, pp. 639-640; Mandeville, p. 231, on
the titles borne on the seals of the Great Khan, with Plano
Carpini, p. 715, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The account of Prester John is taken from the famous <i>Epistle</i>
of that imaginary potentate, which was so widely diffused in the
13th century, and created that renown which made it incumbent
on every traveller in Asia to find some new tale to tell of him.
Many fabulous stories, again, of monsters, such as cyclopes,
sciapodes, hippopodes, monoscelides, anthropophagi, and men
whose heads did grow beneath their shoulders, of the phoenix and
the weeping crocodile, such as Pliny has collected, are introduced
here and there, derived no doubt from him, Solinus, the bestiaries,
or the <i>Speculum naturale</i> of Vincent de Beauvais. And
interspersed, especially in the chapters about the Levant, are the
stories and legends that were retailed to every pilgrim, such
as the legend of Seth and the grains of paradise from which
grew the wood of the cross, that of the shooting of old Cain by
Lamech, that of the castle of the sparrow-hawk (which appears
in the tale of Melusina), those of the origin of the balsam plants
at Ma&#7789;ar&#299;ya, of the dragon of Cos, of the river Sabbation, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Even in that part of the book which might be supposed to
represent some genuine experience there are the plainest traces
that another work has been made use of, more or less&mdash;we might
almost say as a framework to fill up. This is the itinerary of the
German knight Wilhelm von Boldensele, written in 1336 at the
desire of Cardinal Talleyrand de Perigord.<a name="fa7k" id="fa7k" href="#ft7k"><span class="sp">7</span></a> A cursory comparison
of this with Mandeville leaves no doubt that the latter
has followed its thread, though digressing on every side, and too
often eliminating the singular good sense of the German traveller.
We may indicate as examples Boldensele&rsquo;s account of Cyprus
(Mandeville, p. 28 and p. 10), of Tyre and the coast of Palestine
(Mandeville, 29, 30, 33, 34), of the journey from Gaza to Egypt
(34), passages about Babylon of Egypt (40), about Mecca (42),
the general account of Egypt (45), the pyramids (52), some of the
wonders of Cairo, such as the slave-market, the chicken-hatching
stoves, and the apples of paradise, <i>i.e.</i> plantains (49), the Red Sea
(57), the convent on Sinai (58, 60), the account of the church of
the Holy Sepulchre (74-76), &amp;c. There is, indeed, only a small
residuum of the book to which genuine character, as containing
the experiences of the author, can possibly be attributed. Yet,
as has been intimated, the borrowed stories are frequently
claimed as such experiences. In addition to those already
mentioned, he alleges that he had witnessed the curious exhibition
of the garden of transmigrated souls (described by Odoric)
at Cansay, <i>i.e.</i> Hangchow-fu (211). He and his fellows with
their valets had remained fifteen months in service with the
emperor of Cathay in his wars against the king of Manzi&mdash;Manzi,
or Southern China, having ceased to be a separate kingdom some
seventy years before the time referred to. But the most notable
of these false statements occurs in his adoption from Odoric of the
story of the Valley Perilous (282). This is, in its original form,
apparently founded on real experiences of Odoric viewed through
a haze of excitement and superstition. Mandeville, whilst
swelling the wonders of the tale with a variety of extravagant
touches, appears to safeguard himself from the reader&rsquo;s possible
discovery that it was stolen by the interpolation: &ldquo;And some
of our fellows accorded to enter, and some not. So there were
with us two worthy men, Friars Minor, that were of Lombardy,
who said that if any man would enter they would go in with us.
And when they had said so, upon the gracious trust of God and
of them, we caused mass to be sung, and made every man to be
shriven and houselled; and then we entered, fourteen persons;
but at our going out we were but nine,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>

<p>In referring to this passage it is only fair to recognize that the
description (though the suggestion of the greatest part exists in
Odoric) displays a good deal of imaginative power; and there is
much in the account of Christian&rsquo;s passage through the Valley
of the Shadow of Death, in Bunyan&rsquo;s famous allegory, which
indicates a possibility that John Bunyan may have read and
remembered this episode either in Mandeville or in Hakluyt&rsquo;s
Odoric.</p>

<p>Nor does it follow that the whole work is borrowed or fictitious.
Even the great Moorish traveller Ibn Batuta, accurate and veracious
in the main, seems&mdash;in one part at least of his narrative&mdash;to
invent experiences; and in such works as those of Jan van Hees
and Arnold von Harff we have examples of pilgrims to the Holy
Land whose narratives begin apparently in sober truth, and
gradually pass into flourishes of fiction and extravagance. So
in Mandeville also we find particulars not yet traced to other
writers, and which may therefore be provisionally assigned
either to the writer&rsquo;s own experience or to knowledge acquired by
colloquial intercourse in the East.</p>

<p>It is difficult to decide on the character of his statements as to
recent Egyptian history. In his account of that country (pp. 37,
38) though the series of the Comanian (<i>i.e.</i> of the Bahri Mameluke)
sultans is borrowed from Hetoum down to the accession of
<i>Melechnasser</i>, <i>i.e.</i> Malik al-N&#257;&#7779;ir (N&#257;&#7779;ir ud-din Mahommed), who
came first to the throne in 1293, Mandeville appears to speak
from his own knowledge when he adds that this &ldquo;<i>Melechnasser</i>
reigned long and governed wisely.&rdquo; In fact, though twice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page563" id="page563"></a>563</span>
displaced in the early part of his life, Malik N&#257;&#7779;ir reigned till 1341,
a duration unparalleled in Mahommedan Egypt, whilst we are
told that during the last thirty years of his reign Egypt rose to a
high pitch of wealth and prosperity. Mandeville, however, then
goes on to say that his eldest son, <i>Melechemader</i>, was chosen to
succeed; but this prince was caused privily to be slain by his
brother, who took the kingdom under the name of <i>Melechmadabron</i>.
&ldquo;And he was Soldan when I departed from those countries.&rdquo;
Now Malik N&#257;&#7779;ir Mahommed was followed in succession
by no less than eight of his sons in thirteen years, the first three
of whom reigned in aggregate only a few months. The names
mentioned by Mandeville appear to represent those of the fourth
and sixth of the eight, viz. &#7778;ali&#7717; &lsquo;Im&#257;d ud-din Ism&#257;&rsquo;&#299;l, and
Mo&#7827;affar (Saif ud-din &#7716;ajj&#299;); and these the statements of
Mandeville do not fit.</p>

<p>On several occasions Arabic words are given, but are not
always recognizable, owing perhaps to the carelessness of copyists
in such matters. Thus, we find (p. 50) the names (not satisfactorily
identified) of the wood, fruit and sap of the balsam
plant; (p. 99) of bitumen, &ldquo;alkatran&rdquo; (<i>al-K&#257;&#7789;r&#257;n</i>); (p. 168) of
the three different kinds of pepper (long pepper, black pepper and
white pepper) as <i>sorbotin</i>, <i>fulful</i> and <i>bano</i> or <i>bauo</i> (<i>fulful</i> is the
common Arabic word for pepper; the others have not been satisfactorily
explained). But these, and the particulars of his narrative
for which no literary sources have yet been found, are too few
to constitute a proof of personal experience.</p>

<p>Mandeville, again, in some passages shows a correct idea of the
form of the earth, and of position in latitude ascertained by
observation of the pole star; he knows that there are antipodes,
and that if ships were sent on voyages of discovery they might
sail round the world. And he tells a curious story, which he
had heard in his youth, how a worthy man did travel ever eastward
until he came to his own country again (p. 183). But he
repeatedly asserts the old belief that Jerusalem was in the centre
of the world (79, 183), and maintains in proof of this that at the
equinox a spear planted erect in Jerusalem casts no shadow at
noon, which, if true, would equally consist with the sphericity of
the earth, provided that the city were on the equator.</p>

<p>The sources of the book, which include various authors besides
those whom we have specified, have been laboriously investigated
by Dr Albert Bovenschen<a name="fa8k" id="fa8k" href="#ft8k"><span class="sp">8</span></a> and Dr G. F. Warner,<a name="fa9k" id="fa9k" href="#ft9k"><span class="sp">9</span></a> and to them
the reader must be referred for more detailed information on the
subject.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The oldest known MS. of the original&mdash;once Barrois&rsquo;s, afterwards
the earl of Ashburnham&rsquo;s, now Nouv. Acq. Franç. 4515 in the
Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris&mdash;is dated 1371, but is nevertheless
very inaccurate in proper names. An early printed Latin translation
made from the French has been already quoted, but four others,
unprinted, have been discovered by Dr J. Vogels.<a name="fa10k" id="fa10k" href="#ft10k"><span class="sp">10</span></a> They exist in
eight MSS., of which seven are in Great Britain, while the eighth
was copied by a monk of Abingdon; probably, therefore, all these
unprinted translations were executed in this country. From one
of them, according to Dr Vogels,<a name="fa11k" id="fa11k" href="#ft11k"><span class="sp">11</span></a> an English version was made
which has never been printed and is now extant only in free abbreviations,
contained in two 15th century MSS. in the Bodleian Library,
Oxford&mdash;MS. e Museo 116, and MS. Rawlinson D. 99: the former,
which is the better, is in Midland dialect, and may possibly have
belonged to the Augustinian priory of St Osyth in Essex, while the
latter is in Southern dialect.</p>

<p>The first English translation direct from the French was made
(at least as early as the beginning of the 15th century) from a MS.
of which many pages were lost.<a name="fa12k" id="fa12k" href="#ft12k"><span class="sp">12</span></a> Writing of the name Califfes
(Khalif), the author says (<i>Roxburghe Club ed.</i>, p. 18) that it is <i>tant a dire
come roi(s). Il y soleit auoir v. soudans</i>&mdash;&ldquo;as much as to say king.
There used to be 5 sultans.&rdquo; In the defective French MS. a page
ended with <i>Il y so</i>; then came a gap, and the next page went on with
part of the description of Mount Sinai, <i>Et est celle vallee mult froide</i>
(ibid. p. 32). Consequently the corresponding English version has
&ldquo;That ys to say amonge hem <i>Roys Ils</i> and this vale ys ful colde&rdquo;!
All English printed texts before 1725, and Ashton&rsquo;s 1887 edition,
follow these defective copies, and in only two known MSS. has the
lacuna been detected and filled up.</p>

<p>One of them is the British Museum MS. Egerton 1982 (Northern
dialect, about 1410-1420?), in which, according to Dr Vogels, the
corresponding portion has been borrowed from that English version
which had already been made from the Latin. The other is in the
British Museum MS. Cotton Titus C. xvi. (Midland dialect, about
1410-1420?), representing a text completed, and revised throughout,
from the French, though not by a competent hand. The Egerton
text, edited by Dr G. F. Warner, has been printed by the Roxburghe
Club, while the Cotton text, first printed in 1725 and 1727, is in
modern reprints the current English version.</p>

<p>That none of the forms of the English version can be from the
same hand which wrote the original is made patent by their glaring
errors of translation, but the Cotton text asserts in the preface that
it was made by Mandeville himself, and this assertion was till lately
taken on trust by almost all modern historians of English literature.
The words of the original &ldquo;je eusse cest livret mis en latin ... mais
... je l&rsquo;ay mis en r&#333;mant&rdquo; were mistranslated as if &ldquo;je eusse&rdquo;
meant &ldquo;I had&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;I should have,&rdquo; and then (whether of
fraudulent intent or by the error of a copyist thinking to supply an
accidental omission) the words were added &ldquo;and translated it
agen out of Frensche into Englyssche.&rdquo; M&#257;tzner (<i>Altenglische
Sprachproben</i>, I., ii., 154-155) seems to have been the first to show
that the current English text cannot possibly have been made by
Mandeville himself. Of the original French there is no satisfactory
edition, but Dr Vogels has undertaken a critical text, and Dr Warner
has added to his Egerton English text the French of a British
Museum MS. with variants from three others.</p>

<p>It remains to mention certain other works bearing the name of
Mandeville or de Bourgogne.</p>

<p>MS. Add. C. 280 in the Bodleian appends to the &ldquo;Travels&rdquo; a
short French life of St Alban of <i>Germany</i>, the author of which calls
himself Joh<span class="sp">a</span>n Mandivill[e], knight, formerly of the town of St Alban,
and says he writes to correct an impression prevalent among his
countrymen that there was no other saint of the name: this life
is followed by part of a French herbal.</p>

<p>To Mandeville (by whom de Bourgogne is clearly meant) d&rsquo;Oultremouse<a name="fa13k" id="fa13k" href="#ft13k"><span class="sp">13</span></a>
ascribes a Latin &ldquo;lappidaire selon l&rsquo;oppinion des Indois,&rdquo;
from which he quotes twelve passages, stating that the author (whom
he calls knight, lord of Montfort, of Castelperouse, and of the isle of
Campdi) had been &ldquo;baillez en Alexandrie&rdquo; seven years, and had
been presented by a Saracen friend with some fine jewels which had
passed into d&rsquo;Oultremouse&rsquo;s own possession: of this <i>Lapidaire</i>,
a French version, which seems to have been completed after 1479,
has been several times printed.<a name="fa14k" id="fa14k" href="#ft14k"><span class="sp">14</span></a> A MS. of Mandeville&rsquo;s travels
offered for sale in 1862<a name="fa15k" id="fa15k" href="#ft15k"><span class="sp">15</span></a> is said to have been divided into five books:
(1) the travels, (2) <i>de là forme de la terre et comment et par quelle
manière elle fut faite</i>, (3) <i>de la forme del ciel</i>, (4) <i>des herbes selon les
yndois et les philosophes par de là</i>, and (5) <i>ly lapidaire</i>&mdash;while the
cataloguer supposed Mandeville to have been the author of a concluding
piece entitled <i>La Venianche de nostre Signeur Ihesu-Crist
fayte par Vespasian fil del empereur de Romme et comment Iozeph
daramathye fu deliures de la prizon</i>. From the treatise on herbs a
passage is quoted asserting it to have been composed in 1357 in
honour of the author&rsquo;s natural lord, Edward, king of England. This
date is corroborated by the title of king of Scotland given to Edward,
who had received from Baliol the surrender of the crown and kingly
dignity on the 20th of January 1356, but on the 3rd of October 1357
released King David and made peace with Scotland: unfortunately
we are not told whether the treatise contains the author&rsquo;s name, and,
if so, <i>what</i> name. Tanner (<i>Bibliotheca</i>) alleges that Mandeville
wrote several books on medicine, and among the Ashmolean
MSS. in the Bodleian are a medical receipt by John de Magna Villa
(No. 1479), an alchemical receipt by him (No. 1407), and another
alchemical receipt by Johannes de Villa Magna (No. 1441).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page564" id="page564"></a>564</span></p>

<p>Finally, de Bourgogne wrote under his own name a treatise on the
plague,<a name="fa16k" id="fa16k" href="#ft16k"><span class="sp">16</span></a> extant in Latin, French and English texts, and in Latin
and English abridgments. Herein he describes himself as Johannes
de Burgundia, otherwise called <i>cum Barba</i>, citizen of Liége and
professor of the art of medicine; says that he had practised forty
years and had been in Liége in the plague of 1365; and adds that he
had previously written a treatise on the cause of the plague, according
to the indications of astrology (beginning <i>Deus deorum</i>), and another
on distinguishing pestilential diseases (beginning <i>Cum nimium
propter instans tempus epidimiale</i>). &ldquo;Burgundia&rdquo; is sometimes
corrupted into &ldquo;Burdegalia,&rdquo; and in English translations of the
abridgment almost always appears as &ldquo;Burdews&rdquo; (Bordeaux) or
the like. MS. Rawlinson D. 251 (15th century) in the Bodleian also
contains a large number of English medical receipts, headed
&ldquo;P<i>r</i>actica phisicalia M<i>agist</i>ri Joh<i>ann</i>is de Burgu<i>n</i>dia.&rdquo;</p>

great parallel ranges, reaching to an average height of 5000 to
7000 ft. above sea-level. The valleys between the hill ranges are
fertile, and produce all the ordinary grains, besides more valuable
crops of rice, maize, sugar-cane, poppy and tobacco. Iron is
found in places, and also gold in small quantities. Area, 1200

<p><span class="bold">MANDINGO,<a name="ar71" id="ar71"></a></span> the name currently given to a very important
division of negro peoples in West Africa. It is seemingly a corruption
of a term applied to an important section of this group, the
Mande-nka or Mande-nga. The present writer has usually heard
this word pronounced by the Mandingo themselves &ldquo;Mandiña,&rdquo;
or even &ldquo;Madiña.&rdquo; It seems to be derived from the racial name
<i>Mande</i>, coupled with the suffix <i>nka</i> or <i>nke</i>, meaning &ldquo;people,&rdquo;
the people of Mande. Then again this word Mande seems to
take the varying forms of <i>Male</i>, <i>Meli</i>, <i>Mane</i>, <i>Madi</i>, and, according
to such authorities as Binger, Delafosse and Desplagnes,
it is connected with a word <i>Mali</i>, which means &ldquo;hippopotamus&rdquo;
or else &ldquo;manati&rdquo;&mdash;probably the latter. According to Desplagnes,
the word is further divisible into <i>ma</i>, which would have
meant &ldquo;fish,&rdquo; and <i>nde</i>, a syllable to which he ascribes the meaning
of &ldquo;father.&rdquo; In no Mandingo dialect known to the present
writer (or in any other known African language) does the vocable
<i>ma</i> apply to &ldquo;fish,&rdquo; and in only one very doubtful far eastern
Mandingo dialect is the root <i>nde</i> or any other similar sound
applied to &ldquo;father.&rdquo; This etymology must be abandoned,
probably in favour of <i>Mani</i>, <i>Mali</i>, <i>Madi</i>, <i>Mande</i>, meaning
&ldquo;hippopotamus,&rdquo; and in some cases the other big water mammal,
the manati.<a name="fa1l" id="fa1l" href="#ft1l"><span class="sp">1</span></a></p>

<p>The West African tribes speaking Mandingo languages vary
very much in outward appearance. Some of them may be West
African negroes of the forest type with little or no intermixture
with the Caucasian; others, such as the typical Mandingos or the
Susus, obviously contain a non-negro element in their physique.
This last type resembles very strongly the Swahilis of the Zanzibar
littoral or other crosses between the Arab and the negro;
and though nearly always black-skinned, often has a well-shaped
nose and a fairly full beard. The tribes dwelling in the West
African forest, but speaking languages of Mandingo type, do not
perhaps exhibit the very prognathous, short-limbed, &ldquo;ugly&rdquo; development
of West African negro, but are of rather a refined type,
and some of them are lighter in skin colour than the more Arab-looking
Mandingos of the north. But in these forest Mandingos
the beard is scanty. Occasionally the Mandingo physical type
appears in eastern Liberia and on the Ivory Coast amongst
people speaking Kru languages. In other cases it is associated
with the Senufo speech-family.</p>

<p>Delafosse divides the Mandingo group linguistically into three
main sections: (1) the <i>Mande-tamu</i>, (2) the <i>Mande-fu</i>, and (3) the
<i>Mande-tã</i>, according as they use for the numeral 10 the root
<i>tamu</i>, <i>tã</i> or <i>fu</i>. Of the first group are the important tribes of the
Soni-nké (called Sarakulle by the Fula, and Sarakolé by the
French); the Swaninki people of Azer, and the oases of Tishitt,
Wadan and Walata in the south-west Sahara; and the Bozo,
who are the fishermen along the banks of the Upper Niger and
the Bani from Jenné to Timbuktu. The Soni-nké are also known
as Marka, and they include (according to Binger) the Samogho
and even the Kurtei along the banks of the Niger east of
Timbuktu as far as Say.</p>

<p>The group of Mande-tã would include the Bamana (incorrectly
called Bambara) of the upper Senegal and of Segu on the Upper
Niger, the Toronke, the Mandenga, the Numu of the district west
of the Black Volta, the Vai of south-western Liberia, and the
Dyula or Gyula of the region at the back of the Ivory Coast.</p>

<p>The group of the Mande-fu includes a great many different
languages and dialects, chiefly in the forest region of Sierra Leone
and Liberia, and also the dialects of the celebrated Susu or Soso
tribe, and the Mandingo tribes of Futa Jallon, of the Grand
Scarcies River and of the interior of the Ivory Coast, and of the
regions between the eastern affluents of the Upper Niger and the
Black Volta. To this group Delafosse joins the Boko dialect
spoken by people dwelling to the west of the Lower Niger at
Bussa&mdash;between Bussa and Borgu. If this hypothesis be correct
it gives a curious eastern extension to the range of the Mandingo
family at the present day; or it may be a vestige left by the Mandingo
invasion which, according to legend, came in prehistoric
times from the Hausa countries across the Niger to Senegambia.
It is remarkable that this Boko dialect as recorded by the
missionary Koelle most resembles certain dialects in central
Liberia and in the Ivory Coast hinterland.</p>

<p>The Mandingos, coming from the East and riding on horses
(according to tradition), seem to have invaded western Nigeria
about <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 1000 (if not earlier), and to have gradually displaced
and absorbed the Songhai or Fula (in other words, Negroid,
&ldquo;White&rdquo;) rulers of the countries in the basin of the Upper Niger
or along its navigable course as far as the Bussa Rapids and the
forest region. On the ruins of these Songhai, Berber, or Fula
kingdoms rose the empire of Mali (Melle). Considerable sections
of the Mandingo invaders had adopted Mahommedanism, and
extended a great Mahommedan empire of western Nigeria far
northwards into the Sahara Desert. In the 16th century the
Songhai regained supreme power. See <i>infra</i>, § <i>The Melle Empire</i>.</p>

<p>Although the Mandingos, and especially the Susu section, may
have come as conquerors, they devoted themselves through the
succeeding centuries more and more to commerce. They became
to the extreme west of Africa what the Hausa are in the west-central
regions. Some of the Mandingo invasions, especially in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page565" id="page565"></a>565</span>
the forest region, left little more than the imposition of their
language; but where there was any element of Caucasian blood
(for the original Mandingo invaders were evidently dashed with
the Caucasian by intermingling with some of the negroid races
of north-central Africa), they imposed a degree of civilization
which excluded cannibalism (still rampant in much of the forest
region of West Africa), introduced working in leather and in
metals, and was everywhere signalized by a passionate love of
music, a characteristic of all true Mandingo tribes at the present
day. It is noteworthy that many of the instruments affected
by the Mandingos are found again in the more civilized regions
of Bantu Africa, as well as in the central Sudan. Many of these
types of musical instruments can also be traced originally to
ancient Egypt. The Mandingos also seem to have brought with
them in their westward march the Egyptian type of ox, with the
long, erect horns. It would almost seem as if this breed had been
preceded by the zebu or humped ox; though these two types are
evidently of common origin so far as derivation from one wild
species is concerned. The Mandingos maintain the system of
totems or clans, and each section or tribe identifies itself with a
symbol, which is usually an animal or a plant. The Mandenga
are supposed to have either the manati or the hippopotamus
as <i>tanna</i>. (Binger states that the manati was the
totem of the Mande group, to which perhaps belonged originally
the Susu and the Dyula.) The Bamana are the people of the
crocodile; the Samanke are the people of the elephant; the
Samokho of the snake. Other totems or symbols of special
families or castes are the dog, the calabash or gourd, the lion,
the green monkey, the leopard, the monitor lizard, a certain
spice called bandugu, certain rats, the python, the puff-adder, &amp;c.</p>

is referred to in the previous section. It is not known by whom
the Melle (Mali) state was founded. Neither is there certainty
as to the site of the capital, also called Melle. Idrisi in the 12th
century describes the Wangara (a Hausa name for the Mandingo)
as a powerful people, and El Bakri writes in similar terms. But
the first king whose name is preserved was Baramindana,
believed to have reigned from 1213 to 1235. His territory lay
south of that of Jenné, partly within the bend of the Niger and
partly west of that river. The people were already Moslem, and
the capital was a rendezvous for merchants from all parts of the
western Sudan and the Barbary States. Mari Jatah (or Diara),
Baramindana&rsquo;s successor, about the middle of the 13th century
conquered the Susu, then masters of Ghanata (Ghana). Early
in the 14th century Mansa, <i>i.e.</i> Sultan, Kunkur Musa, extended
the empire, known as the Mellistine, to its greatest limits, making
himself master of Timbuktu, Gao and all the Songhoi dominions.
His authority extended northward over the Sahara to the Tuat
oases. Mansa Suleiman was on the throne when in 1352-1353
Melle was visited by Ibn Batuta. By this monarch the empire
was divided into three great provinces, ruled by viceroys. For
a century afterwards Melle appears to have been the dominant
Sudan state west of the Lower Niger, but it had to meet the
hostility of the growing power of the pagan Mossi, of the Tuareg
in the north and of the Songhoi, who under Sunni Ali (<i>c.</i> 1325)
had already regained a measure of independence. Cadamosto
nevertheless describes Melle in 1454 as being still the most
powerful of the negro-land kingdoms and the most important
for its traffic in gold and slaves. The Songhoi sovereign Askia
is said to have completed the conquest of Melle at the beginning
of the 16th century. It nevertheless retained some sort of
national existence&mdash;though with the advent of the Moors in the
Niger countries (end of the 16th century) native civilization
suffered a blow from which it never recovered. Civil war is
said to have finally wrought the ruin of Melle about the middle
of the 17th century.<a name="fa2l" id="fa2l" href="#ft2l"><span class="sp">2</span></a> The Portuguese, from their first appearance
on the Senegal and Gambia, entered into friendly relations
with the rulers of Melle. Barros relates (<i>Da Asia</i>, Decade I.)
that John II. of Portugal sent embassies to the court of Melle by
way of the Gambia (end of the 15th century). At that time the
authority of Melle was said to extend westward to the coast.
The king, pressed by the Mossi, the Songhoi and the Fula,
solicited the help of his &ldquo;friends and allies&rdquo; the Portuguese&mdash;with
what result does not appear; but in 1534 Barros himself
despatched an ambassador to the king of Melle concerning the
trade of the Gambia. By way of that river the Portuguese
themselves penetrated as far as Bambuk, a country conquered
by the Mandingo in the 12th century. By Barros the name of
the Melle ruler is given as Mandi Mansa, which may be the
native form for &ldquo;Sultan of the Mandi&rdquo; (Mandingo).</p>

<p><span class="bold">MANDLA,<a name="ar72" id="ar72"></a></span> a town and district of British India, in the Jubbulpore
division of the Central Provinces. The town is on the river
Nerbudda, 1787 ft. above the sea. It has a manufacture of
bell-metal vessels. Pop. (1901), 5054. The district of Mandla,
among the Satpura hills, has an area of 5054 sq. m. It consists
of a wild highland region, broken up by the valleys of numerous
rivers and streams. The Nerbudda flows through the centre of
the district, receiving several tributaries which take their rise
in the Maikal hills, a range densely clothed with <i>s&#257;l</i> forest, and
forming part of the great watershed between eastern and
western India. The loftiest mountain is Chauradadar, about
3400 ft. high. Tigers abound, and the proportion of deaths
caused by wild animals is greater than in any other district of the
Central Provinces. The magnificent <i>s&#257;l</i> forests which formerly
clothed the highlands have suffered greatly from the nomadic
system of cultivation practised by the hill tribes, who burned the
wood and sowed their crops in the ashes; but measures have been
taken to prevent further damage. The population in 1901 was
318,400, showing a decrease of 6.5% in the decade, due to
famine. The aboriginal or hill tribes are more numerous in
Mandla than in any other district of the Central Provinces,
particularly the Gonds. The principal crops are rice, wheat,
other food grains, pulse and oilseeds. There is a little manufacture
of country cloth. A branch of the Bengal-Nagpur
railway touches the south-western border of the district.
Mandla suffered most severely from the famine of 1896-1897,
partly owing to its inaccessibility, and partly from the shy
habits of the aboriginal tribes. The registered death-rate in
1907 was as high as 96 per thousand.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MANDOLINE<a name="ar73" id="ar73"></a></span> (Fr. <i>mandoline</i>; Ger. <i>Mandoline</i>; It. <i>mandolina</i>),
the treble member of the lute family, and therefore a stringed
instrument of great antiquity. The mandoline is classified
amongst the stringed instruments having a vaulted back, which
is more accentuated than even that of the lute. The mandoline
is strung with steel and brass wire strings. There are two
varieties of mandolines, both Italian: (1) the <i>Neapolitan</i>, 2 ft.
long, which is the best known, and has four courses of pairs of
unisons tuned like the violin in fifths; (2) the <i>Milanese</i>, which is
slightly larger and has five or six courses of pairs of unisons.
The neck is covered by a finger-board, on which are distributed
the twelve or more frets which form nuts at the correct points
under the strings on which the fingers must press to obtain the
chromatic semitones of the scale. The strings are twanged by
means of a plectrum or pick, held between the thumb and first
finger of the right hand. In order to strike a string the pick is
given a gliding motion over the string combined with a <i>down</i> or an
<i>up</i> movement, respectively indicated by signs over the notes. In
order to sustain notes on the mandoline the effect known as
<i>tremolo</i> is employed; it is produced by means of a double movement
of the pick up and down over a pair of strings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page566" id="page566"></a>566</span></p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The mandoline is a derivative of the mandola or mandore, which
was smaller than the lute but larger than either of the mandolines
described above. It had from four to eight courses of strings,
the <i>chanterelle</i> or melody string being single and the others
in pairs of unisons. The mandore is mentioned in Robert de
Calenson (12th cent.), and elsewhere; it may be identified with the
pandura.</p>

<p>The Neapolitan mandoline was scored for by Mozart as an accompaniment
to the celebrated serenade in <i>Don Juan</i>. Beethoven
wrote for it a <i>Sonatina per il mandolino</i>, dedicated to his friend
Krumpholz. Grétry and Paisiello also introduced it into their
operas as an accompaniment to serenades.</p>

<p>The earliest method for the mandoline was published by Fouchette
in Paris in 1770. The earliest mention of the instrument in England,
in 1707, is quoted in Ashton&rsquo;s <i>Social Life in the Reign of Queen
Anne</i>: &ldquo;Signior Conti will play ... on the mandoline, an
instrument not known yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="bold">MANDRAKE<a name="ar74" id="ar74"></a></span> (<i>Mandragora officinarum</i>), a plant of the potato
family, order Solanaceae, a native of the Mediterranean region.
It has a short stem bearing a tuft of ovate leaves, with a thick
fleshy and often forked root. The flowers are solitary, with a
purple bell-shaped corolla; the fruit is a fleshy orange-coloured
berry. The mandrake has been long known for its poisonous
properties and supposed virtues. It acts as an emetic, purgative
and narcotic, and was much esteemed in old times; but, except
in Africa and the East, where it is used as a narcotic and anti-spasmodic,
it has fallen into well-earned disrepute. In ancient
times, according to Isidorus and Serapion, it was used as a
narcotic to diminish sensibility under surgical operations, and
the same use is mentioned by Kazw&#299;n&#299;, i. 297, <i>s.v.</i> &ldquo;Luff&#257;&#7717;&rdquo;
Shakespeare more than once alludes to this plant, as in <i>Antony
and Cleopatra</i>: &ldquo;Give me to drink mandragora.&rdquo; The notion
that the plant shrieked when touched is alluded to in <i>Romeo and
Juliet</i>: &ldquo;And shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth, that
living mortals, hearing them, run mad.&rdquo; The mandrake, often
growing like the lower limbs of a man, was supposed to have
other virtues, and was much used for love philtres, while the
fruit was supposed, and in the East is still supposed, to facilitate
pregnancy (Aug., <i>C. Faust</i>. xxii. 56; cf. Gen. xxx. 14,
where the Hebrew <span title="dadarom">&#1491;&#1491;&#1512;&#1488;&#1502;</span> is undoubtedly the mandrake). Like
the mallow, the mandrake was potent in all kinds of enchantment
(see Maimonides in Chwolson, <i>Ssabier</i>, ii. 459). Dioscorides
identifies it with the <span class="grk" title="kirkaia">&#954;&#953;&#961;&#954;&#945;&#943;&#945;</span>, the root named after the enchantress
Circe. To it appears to apply the fable of the magical herb
Baaras, which cured demoniacs, and was procured at great risk
or by the death of a dog employed to drag it up, in Josephus
(<i>B. J.</i> vii. 6, § 3). The German name of the plant (<i>Alraune</i>;
O. H. G. <i>Alrûna</i>) indicates the prophetic power supposed to be
in little images (homunculi, Goldmännchen, Galgenmännchen)
made of this root which were cherished as oracles. The
possession of such roots was thought to ensure prosperity.
(See Du Cange, <i>s.vv.</i> &ldquo;Mandragora&rdquo; and Littré.)</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Gerard in 1597 (<i>Herball</i>, p. 280) described male and female
mandrakes, and Dioscorides also recognizes two such plants corresponding
to the spring and autumn species (<i>M. vernalis</i> and <i>M.
officinarum</i> respectively), differing in the colour of the foliage and
shape of fruit.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MANDRILL<a name="ar75" id="ar75"></a></span> (a name formed by the prefix &ldquo;man&rdquo; to the
word &ldquo;drill,&rdquo; which was used in ancient literature to denote
an ape, and is probably of West African origin), the common
title of the most hideous and most brilliantly coloured of all
the African monkeys collectively denominated baboons and
constituting the genus <i>Papio</i>. Together with the <i>drill</i> (<i>q.v.</i>),
the mandrill, <i>Papio maimon</i>, constitutes the subgenus <i>Maimon</i>,
which is exclusively West African in distribution, and characterized,
among other peculiarities, by the extreme shortness of
the tail, and the great development of the longitudinal bony
swellings, covered during life with naked skin, on the sides of
the muzzle. As a whole, the mandrill is characterized by heaviness
of body, stoutness and strength of limb, and exceeding
shortness of tail, which is a mere stump, not 2 in. long, and
usually carried erect. It is, moreover, remarkable for the
prominence of its brow-ridges, beneath which the small and
closely approximated eyes are deeply sunk; the immense size
of the canine teeth; and more especially for the extraordinarily
vivid colouring of some parts of the skin. The body generally
is covered with soft hair&mdash;light olive-brown above and silvery
grey beneath&mdash;and the chin is furnished underneath with a small
pointed yellow beard. The hair of the forehead and temples is
directed upwards so as to meet in a point on the crown, which
gives the head a triangular appearance. The ears are naked,
and bluish black. The hands and feet are naked, and black. A
large space around the greatly developed callosities on the
buttocks, as well as the upper part of the insides of the thighs,
is naked and of a crimson colour, shading off on the sides to
lilac or blue, which, depending upon injection of the superficial
blood-vessels, varies in intensity according to the condition of
the animal&mdash;increasing under excitement, fading during sickness,
and disappearing after death. It is, however, in the face that
the most remarkable disposition of vivid hues occurs, more resembling
those of a brilliantly coloured flower than what might
be expected in a mammal. The cheek-prominences are of an
intense blue, the effect of which is heightened by deeply sunk
longitudinal furrows of a darker tint, while the central line and
termination of the nose are bright scarlet. It is only to fully
adult males that this description applies. The female is of
much smaller size, and more slender; and, though the general
tone of the hairy parts of the body is the same, the prominences,
furrows, and colouring of the face are much less marked. The
young males have black faces.</p>

<p>Old males are remarkable for the ferocity of their disposition,
as well as for other disagreeable qualities; but when young they
can easily be tamed. Like baboons, mandrills appear to be
indiscriminate eaters, feeding on fruit, roots, reptiles, insects,
scorpions, &amp;c., and inhabit open rocky ground rather than
forests. Not much is known of the mandrill&rsquo;s habits in the
wild state, nor of the exact limits of its geographical distribution;
the specimens brought to Europe coming from the west coast
of tropical Africa, from Guinea to the Gaboon. (See also

<p><span class="bold">MANES,<a name="ar79" id="ar79"></a></span> in Roman mythology, the disembodied and immortal
spirits of the dead. The word is an old adjective&mdash;<i>manis</i>, <i>manus</i>,
meaning &ldquo;good,&rdquo; the opposite of which is <i>immanis</i>; hence the
Manes, clearly a euphemistic term, are the &ldquo;good people.&rdquo; They
were looked upon as gods; hence the dedication, of great antiquity
and frequent occurrence, <i>Divis</i> or <i>Dis Manibus</i> in sepulchral
inscriptions, used even in Christian times. When a body
was consumed on the funeral pyre, relations and friends invoked
the deceased as a divinity, and the law of the Twelve Tables
prescribed that the rights of the divine Manes should be respected,
and that each man should regard the dead members of his family
as gods. Their home was in the bowels of the earth, from which
they only emerged at certain times. It was an old Italian
custom&mdash;especially at the foundation of cities&mdash;to dig a pit in
the form of an inverted sky (hence called <i>mundus</i>), the lower
part of which was supposed to be sacred to the gods of the
underworld, including the Manes. Such a pit existed on the
Palatine at Rome. It was covered by a stone called <i>lapis manalis</i>,
representing the entrance to the lower world, which was removed
three times in the year (Aug. 24, Oct. 5, Nov. 8). The Manes
were then believed to issue forth, and these days were regarded
as <i>religiosi</i>&mdash;that is, all important business in public and private
life was suspended. Offerings were made to propitiate the dead:
libations of water, wine, warm milk, honey, oil, and the blood
of sacrificial victims&mdash;black sheep, pigs and oxen (<i>suovetaurilia</i>)&mdash;was
poured upon the graves; ointment and incense were
offered, lamps were lighted, and the grave was adorned with
garlands of flowers, especially roses and violets. Beans, eggs,
lentils, salt, bread and wine, placed on the grave, formed the
chief part of a meal partaken of by the mourners. There was
also a public state festival in honour of the dead, called Parentalia,
held from the 13th to the 21st of February, the last month
of the old Roman year, the last day of the festival being called
Feralia. During its continuance all the temples were shut,
marriages were forbidden, and the magistrates had to appear
without the insignia of their office.</p>

<p>There was considerable analogy between the Manes and the
received idea of &ldquo;souls&rdquo;&mdash;and there was a corresponding idea
that they could be conjured up and appear as ghosts. They
were also supposed to have the power of sending dreams. It is
to be noticed that, unlike the Lares, the Manes are never spoken
of singly.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MANET, ÉDOUARD<a name="ar80" id="ar80"></a></span> (1832-1883), French painter, regarded
as the most important master of Impressionism (<i>q.v.</i>), was born
in Paris on the 23rd of January 1832. After spending some
time under the tuition of the Abbé Poiloup, he entered the
Collège Rollin, where his passion for drawing led him to neglect
all his other lessons. His studies finished in 1848, he was placed
on board the ship <i>Guadeloupe</i>, voyaging to Rio de Janeiro. On
his return he first studied in Couture&rsquo;s studio (1851), where his
independence often infuriated his master. For six years he
was an intermittent visitor to the studio, constantly taking
leave to travel, and going first to Cassel, Dresden, Vienna and
Munich, and afterwards to Florence, Rome and Venice, where
he made some stay. Some important drawings date from this
period, and one picture, &ldquo;A Nymph Surprised.&rdquo; Then, after
imitating Couture, more or less, in &ldquo;The Absinthe-drinker&rdquo;
(1866), and Courbet in &ldquo;The Old Musician,&rdquo; he devoted himself
almost exclusively to the study of the Spanish masters in the
Louvre. A group was already gathering round him&mdash;Whistler,
Legros, and Fantin-Latour haunted his studio in the Rue Guyot.
His &ldquo;Spaniard playing the Guitar,&rdquo; in the Salon of 1861, excited
much animadversion. Delacroix alone defended Manet, but,
this notwithstanding, his &ldquo;Fifer of the Guard&rdquo; and &ldquo;Breakfast
on the Grass&rdquo; were refused by the jury. Then the &ldquo;Exhibition
of the Rejected&rdquo; was opened, and round Manet a group was
formed, including Bracquemond, Legros, Jongkind, Whistler,
Harpignies and Fantin-Latour, the writers Zola, Duranty and
Duret, and Astruc the sculptor. In 1863, when an amateur,
M. Martinet, lent an exhibition-room to Manet, the painter
exhibited fourteen pictures; and then, in 1864, contributed
again to the Salon &ldquo;The Angels at the Tomb&rdquo; and &ldquo;A Bullfight.&rdquo;
Of this picture he afterwards kept nothing but the
toreador in the foreground, and it is now known as &ldquo;The Dead
Man.&rdquo; In 1865 he sent to the Salon &ldquo;Christ reviled by the
Soldiers&rdquo; and the famous &ldquo;Olympia,&rdquo; which was hailed with
mockery and laughter. It represents a nude woman reclining
on a couch, behind which is seen the head of a negress who
carries a bunch of flowers. A black cat at her feet emphasizes
the whiteness of the sheet on which the woman lies. This
work (now in the Louvre) was presented to the Luxembourg by
a subscription started by Claude Monet (1890). It was hung
in 1897 among the Caillebotte collection, which included the
&ldquo;Balcony,&rdquo; and a study of a female head called &ldquo;Angelina.&rdquo;
This production, of a highly independent individuality, secured
Manet&rsquo;s exclusion from the Salon of 1866, so that he determined
to exhibit his pictures in a place apart during the Great Exhibition
of 1867. In a large gallery in the Avenue de l&rsquo;Alma, half
of which was occupied by Courbet, he hung no fewer than fifty
paintings. Only one important picture was absent, &ldquo;The
Execution of the Emperor Maximilian&rdquo;; its exhibition was
prohibited by the authorities. From that time, in spite of the
fierce hostility of some adversaries, Manet&rsquo;s energy and that
of his supporters began to gain the day. His &ldquo;Young Girl&rdquo;
(Salon of 1868) was justly appreciated, as well as the portrait
of Lola; but the &ldquo;Balcony&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Breakfast&rdquo; (1869)
were as severely handled as the &ldquo;Olympia&rdquo; had been. In
1870 he exhibited &ldquo;The Music Lesson&rdquo; and a portrait of Mlle
E. Gonzales. Not long before the Franco-Prussian War, Manet,
finding himself in the country with a friend, for the first time
discovered the true value of open air to the effects of painting
in his picture &ldquo;The Garden,&rdquo; which gave rise to the &ldquo;open
air&rdquo; or <i>plein air</i> school. After fighting as a gunner, he returned
to his family in the Pyrenees, where he painted &ldquo;The Battle of
the <i>Kearsarge</i> and the <i>Alabama</i>.&rdquo; His &ldquo;Bon Bock&rdquo; (1873)
created a <i>furore</i>. But in 1875, as in 1869, there was a fresh
outburst of abuse, this time of the &ldquo;Railroad,&rdquo; &ldquo;Polichinelle,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Argenteuil,&rdquo; and the jury excluded the artist, who for
the second time arranged an exhibition in his studio. In 1877
his &ldquo;Hamlet&rdquo; was admitted to the Salon, but &ldquo;Nana&rdquo; was
rejected. The following works were exhibited at the Salon of
1881: &ldquo;In the Conservatory,&rdquo; &ldquo;In a Boat,&rdquo; and the portraits
of Rochefort and Proust; and the Cross of the Legion of Honour
was conferred on the painter on the 31st of December in that
year. Manet died in Paris on the 20th of April 1883. He left,
besides his pictures, a number of pastels and engravings. He
illustrated <i>Les Chats</i> by Champfleury, and Edgar Allan Poe&rsquo;s
<i>The Raven</i>.</p>

in a papyrus), Egyptian priest and annalist, was a native of
Sebennytus in the Delta. The name which he bears has a
good Egyptian appearance, and has been found on a contemporary
papyrus probably referring to the man himself. The
evidence of Plutarch and other indications connect him with
the reigns of Ptolemy I. and II. His most important work was
an Egyptian history in Greek, for which he translated the native
records. It is now only known by some fragments of narrative
in Josephus&rsquo;s treatise <i>Against Apion</i>, and by tables of dynasties
and kings with lengths of reigns, divided into three books, in
the works of Christian chronographers. The earliest and best
of the latter is Julius Africanus, besides whom Eusebius and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page568" id="page568"></a>568</span>
some falsifying apologists offer the same materials; the chief
text is that preserved in the <i>Chronographia</i> of Georgius Syncellus.
It is difficult to judge the value of the original from these extracts:
it is clear from the different versions of the lists that
they have been corrupted. Manetho&rsquo;s work was probably based
on native lists like that of the Turin Papyrus of Kings: even
his division into dynasties may have been derived from such.
The fragments of narrative give a very confused idea of Egyptian
history in the time of the Hyksos and the XVIIIth Dynasty.
The royal lists, too, are crowded with errors of detail, both
in the names and order of the kings, and in the lengths attributed
to the reigns. The brief notes attached to some of the names
may be derived from Manetho&rsquo;s narrative, but they are chiefly
references to kings mentioned by Herodotus or to marvels that
were supposed to have occurred: they certainly possess little
historical value. A puzzling annotation to the name of
Bocchoris, &ldquo;in whose time a lamb spake 990 years,&rdquo; has been
well explained by Krall&rsquo;s reading of a demotic story written in
the twenty-third year of Augustus. According to this a lamb
prophesied that after Bocchoris&rsquo;s reign Egypt should be in the
hands of the oppressor 900 years; in Africanus&rsquo;s day it was
necessary to lengthen the period in order to keep up the spirits
of the patriots after the stated term had expired. This is
evidently not from the pure text of Manetho. Notwithstanding
all their defects, the fragments of Manetho have provided the
accepted scheme of Egyptian dynasties and have been of great
service to scholars ever since the first months of Champollion&rsquo;s
decipherment.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MANFRED<a name="ar83" id="ar83"></a></span> (<i>c.</i> 1232-1266), king of Sicily, was a natural son
of the emperor Frederick II. by Bianca Lancia, or Lanzia, who
is reported on somewhat slender evidence to have been married
to the emperor just before his death. Frederick himself appears
to have regarded Manfred as legitimate, and by his will named
him as prince of Tarentum and appointed him as the representative
in Italy of his half-brother, the German king, Conrad IV.
Although only about eighteen years of age Manfred acted loyally
and with vigour in the execution of his trust, and when Conrad
appeared in southern Italy in 1252 his authority was quickly
and generally acknowledged. When in May 1254 the German
king died, Manfred, after refusing to surrender Sicily to Pope
Innocent IV., accepted the regency on behalf of Conradin, the
infant son of Conrad. But the strength of the papal party in
the Sicilian kingdom rendered the position of the regent so
precarious that he decided to open negotiations with Innocent.
By a treaty made in September 1254, Apulia passed under the
authority of the pope, who was personally conducted by Manfred
into his new possession. But Manfred&rsquo;s suspicions being aroused
by the demeanour of the papal retinue, he fled to the Saracens
at Lucera. Aided by Saracen allies, he defeated the papal
troops at Foggia on the 2nd of December 1254, and soon established
his authority over Sicily and the Sicilian possessions on
the mainland.</p>

<p>Taking advantage in 1258 of a rumour that Conradin was
dead, Manfred was crowned king of Sicily at Palermo on the
10th of August in that year. The falsehood of this report was
soon manifest; but the new king, supported by the popular
voice, declined to abdicate, and pointed out to Conradin&rsquo;s envoys
the necessity for a strong native ruler. But the pope, to whom
the Saracen alliance was a serious offence, declared Manfred&rsquo;s
coronation void and pronounced sentence of excommunication.
Undeterred by this sentence Manfred sought to obtain power
in central and northern Italy, and in conjunction with the
Ghibellines his forces defeated the Guelphs at Monte Aperto on
the 4th of September 1260. He was then recognized as protector
of Tuscany by the citizens of Florence, who did homage to his
representative, and he was chosen senator of the Romans by a
faction in the city. Terrified by these proceedings, Pope Urban
IV. implored aid from France, and persuaded Charles count of
Anjou, a brother of King Louis IX., to accept the investiture
of the kingdom of Sicily at his hands. Hearing of the approach
of Charles, Manfred issued a manifesto to the Romans, in which
he not only defended his rule over Italy but even claimed the
imperial crown. The rival armies met near Benevento on the
26th of February 1266, where, although the Germans fought
with undaunted courage, the cowardice of the Italians quickly
brought destruction on Manfred&rsquo;s army. The king himself,
refusing to fly, rushed into the midst of his enemies and was
killed. Over his body, which was buried on the battlefield, a
huge heap of stones was placed, but afterwards with the consent
of the pope the remains were unearthed, cast out of the
papal territory, and interred on the banks of the Liris. Manfred
was twice married. His first wife was Beatrice, daughter of
Amadeus IV. count of Savoy, by whom he had a daughter,
Constance, who became the wife of Peter III. king of Aragon;
and his second wife, who died in prison in 1271, was Helena,
daughter of Michael II. despot of Epirus. Contemporaries
praise the noble and magnanimous character of Manfred,
who was renowned for his physical beauty and intellectual
attainments.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MANGAN, JAMES CLARENCE<a name="ar88" id="ar88"></a></span> (1803-1849), Irish poet, was
born in Dublin on the 1st of May 1803. His baptismal name
was James, the &ldquo;Clarence&rdquo; being his own addition. His
father, a grocer, who boasted of the terror with which he inspired
his children, had ruined himself by imprudent speculation and
extravagant hospitality. The burden of supporting the family
fell on James, who entered a scrivener&rsquo;s office, at the age of
fifteen, and drudged as a copying clerk for ten years. He was
employed for some time in the library of Trinity College, and in
1833 he found a place in the Irish Ordnance Survey. He suffered
a disappointment in love, and continued ill health drove him to
the use of opium. He was habitually the victim of hallucinations
which at times threatened his reason. For Charles Maturin, the
eccentric author of <i>Melmoth</i>, he cherished a deep admiration, the
results of which are evident in his prose stories. He belonged
to the Comet Club, a group of youthful enthusiasts who carried
on war in their paper, the <i>Comet</i>, against the levying of tithes
on behalf of the Protestant clergy. Contributions to the
<i>Dublin Penny Journal</i> followed; and to the <i>Dublin University
Magazine</i> he sent translations from the German poets. The
mystical tendency of German poetry had a special appeal for
him. He chose poems that were attuned to his own melancholy
temperament, and did much that was excellent in this field. He
also wrote versions of old Irish poems, though his knowledge of
the language, at any rate at the beginning of his career, was but
slight. Some of his best-known Irish poems, however, <i>O&rsquo;Hussey&rsquo;s
Ode to the Maguire</i>, for instance, follow the originals very closely.
Besides these were &ldquo;translations&rdquo; from Arabic, Turkish and
Persian. How much of these languages he knew is uncertain,
but he had read widely in Oriental subjects, and some of the
poems are exquisite though the original authors whom he cites
are frequently mythical. He took a mischievous pleasure in
mystifying his readers, and in practising extraordinary metres.
For the <i>Nation</i> he wrote from the beginning (1842) of its career,
and much of his best work appeared in it. He afterwards contributed
to the <i>United Irishman</i>. On the 20th of June 1849 he
died at Meath Hospital, Dublin, of cholera. It was alleged at
the time that starvation was the real cause. This statement
was untrue, but there is no doubt that his wretched poverty
made him ill able to withstand disease.</p>

<p>Mangan holds a high place among Irish poets, but his fame was
deferred by the inequality and mass of his work, much of which
lay buried in inaccessible newspaper files under his many
pseudonyms, &ldquo;Vacuus,&rdquo; &ldquo;Terrae Filius,&rdquo; &ldquo;Clarence,&rdquo; &amp;c.
Of his genius, morbid though it sometimes is, as in his tragic
autobiographical ballad of <i>The Nameless One</i>, there can be no
question. He expressed with rare sincerity the tragedy of
Irish hopes and aspirations, and he furnished abundant proof
of his versatility in his excellent nonsense verses, which are in
strange contrast with the general trend of his work.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>An autobiography which appeared in the <i>Irish Monthly</i> (1882) does
not reproduce the real facts of his career with any fidelity. For
some time after his death there was no adequate edition of his works,
but <i>German Anthology</i> (1845), and <i>The Poets and Poetry of Munster</i>
(1849) had appeared during his lifetime. In 1850 Hercules Ellis
included thirty of his ballads in his <i>Romances and Ballads of Ireland</i>.
Other selections appeared subsequently, notably one (1897), by Miss
L. I. Guiney. <i>The Poems of James Clarence <span class="correction" title="amended from Magan">Mangan</span></i> (1903), and the
<i>Prose Writings</i> (1904), were both edited by D. J. O&rsquo;Donoghue, who
wrote in 1897 a complete account of the <i>Life and Writings</i> of the poet.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MANGANESE<a name="ar89" id="ar89"></a></span> [symbol Mn; atomic weight, 54.93 (O = 16)], a
metallic chemical element. Its dioxide (pyrolusite) has been
known from very early times, and was at first mistaken for a
magnetic oxide of iron. In 1740 J. H. Pott showed that it did
not contain iron and that it yielded a definite series of salts,
whilst in 1774 C. Scheele proved that it was the oxide of a distinctive
metal. Manganese is found widely distributed in nature,
being generally found to a greater or less extent associated with
the carbonates and silicates of iron, calcium and magnesium,
and also as the minerals braunite, hausmannite, psilomelane,
manganite, manganese spar and hauerite. It has also been
recognized in the atmosphere of the sun (A. Cornu, <i>Comptes
rendus</i>, 1878, 86, pp. 315, 530), in sea water, and in many
mineral waters.</p>

<p>The metal was isolated by J. G. Gahn in 1774, and in 1807
J. F. John (<i>Gehlen&rsquo;s Jour. chem. phys.</i>, 1807, 3, p. 452) obtained
an impure metal by reducing the carbonate at a high temperature
with charcoal, mixed with a small quantity of oil. R. Bunsen
prepared the metal by electrolysing manganese chloride in a
porous cell surrounded by a carbon crucible containing hydrochloric
acid. Various reduction methods have been employed
for the isolation of the metal. C. Brunner (<i>Pogg. Ann.</i>, 1857, 101,
p. 264) reduced the fluoride by metallic sodium, and E. Glatzel
(<i>Ber.</i>, 1889, 22, p. 2857) the chloride by magnesium, H. Moissan
(<i>Ann. Chim. Phys.</i>, 1896 (7) 9, p. 286) reduced the oxide with
carbon in the electric furnace; and H. Goldschmidt has
prepared the metal from the oxide by means of his &ldquo;thermite&rdquo;
process (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Chromium</a></span>). W. H. Green and W. H. Wahl
[German patent 70773 (1893)] prepare a 97% manganese from
pyrolusite by heating it with 30% sulphuric acid, the product
being then converted into manganous oxide by heating in a current
of reducing gas at a dull red heat, cooled in a reducing
atmosphere, and finally reduced by heating with granulated
aluminium in a magnesia crucible with lime and fluorspar as
a flux. A purer metal is obtained by reducing manganese
amalgam by hydrogen (O. Prelinger, <i>Monats.</i>, 1894, 14,
p. 353).</p>

<p>Prelinger&rsquo;s manganese has a specific gravity of 7.42, and the
variety obtained by distilling pure manganese amalgam <i>in
vacuo</i> is pyrophoric (A. Guntz, <i>Bull. Soc.</i> [3], 7, 275), and burns
when heated in a current of sulphur dioxide. The pure metal
readily evolves hydrogen when acted upon by sulphuric and
hydrochloric acids, and is readily attacked by dilute nitric
acid. It precipitates many metals from solutions of their salts.
It is employed commercially in the manufacture of special
steels. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Iron and Steel</a></span>.)</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p class="pt1 center"><span class="sc">Compounds</span></p>

<p>Manganese forms several oxides, the most important of which
are manganous oxide, MnO, trimanganese tetroxide, Mn<span class="su">3</span>O<span class="su">4</span>, manganese
sesquioxide, Mn<span class="su">2</span>O<span class="su">3</span>, manganese dioxide, MnO<span class="su">2</span>, manganese
trioxide, MnO<span class="su">3</span>, and manganese heptoxide, Mn<span class="su">3</span>O<span class="su">7</span>.</p>

<p><i>Manganous oxide</i>, MnO, is obtained by heating a mixture of anhydrous
manganese chloride and sodium carbonate with a small quantity
of ammonium chloride (J. v. Liebig and F. Wöhler, <i>Pogg. Ann.</i>,
1830, 21, p. 584); or by reducing the higher oxides with hydrogen
or carbon monoxide. It is a dark coloured powder of specific gravity
5.09. <i>Manganous hydroxide</i>, Mn(OH)<span class="su">2</span>, is obtained as a white precipitate
on adding a solution of a caustic alkali to a manganous salt. For
the preparation of the crystalline variety identical with the mineral
pyrochroite (see A. de Schulten, <i>Comptes rendus</i>, 1887, 105, p. 1265).
It rapidly oxidizes on exposure to air and turns brown, going ultimately
to the sesquioxide. <i>Trimanganese tetroxide</i>, Mn<span class="su">3</span>O<span class="su">4</span>, is produced
more or less pure when the other oxides are heated. It may
be obtained crystalline by heating manganese sulphate and potassium
sulphate to a bright red heat (H. Debray, <i>Comptes rendus</i>,
1861, 52, p. 985). It is a reddish-brown powder, which when heated
with hydrochloric acid yields chlorine. <i>Manganese sesquioxide</i>,
Mn<span class="su">2</span>O<span class="su">3</span>, found native as the mineral braunite, may be obtained
by igniting the other oxides in a mixture of nitrogen and oxygen,
containing not more than 26% of the latter gas (W. Dittmar, <i>Jour.
Chem. Soc.</i>, 1864, 17, p. 294). The hydrated form, found native as
the mineral manganite, is produced by the spontaneous oxidation
of manganous hydroxide. In the hydrated condition it is a dark
brown powder which readily loses water at above 100° C., it dissolves
in hot nitric acid, giving manganous nitrate and manganese dioxide:
2MnO(OH) + 2HNO<span class="su">3</span> = Mn(NO<span class="su">3</span>)<span class="su">2</span> + MnO<span class="su">2</span> + 2H<span class="su">2</span>O. <i>Manganese
dioxide</i>, or pyrolusite (<i>q.v.</i>), MnO<span class="su">2</span>, the most important oxide, may be
prepared by heating crystallized manganous nitrate until red fumes
are given off, decanting the clear liquid, and heating to 150° to
160° C. for 40 to 60 hours (A. Gorgen, <i>Bull. Soc.</i>, 1890 [3], 4, p. 16),
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page570" id="page570"></a>570</span>
or by heating manganese carbonate to 260° C. in the presence
of air and washing the residue with very dilute cold hydrochloric
acid. It is a hard black solid which readily loses oxygen when
strongly heated, leaving a residue of Mn<span class="su">3</span>O<span class="su">4</span>. When heated with
concentrated hydrochloric acid it yields chlorine, and with concentrated
sulphuric acid it yields oxygen. It is reduced to the monoxide
when heated in a current of hydrogen. It is a strong oxidizing agent.
It dissolves in cold concentrated hydrochloric acid, forming a dark
brown solution which probably contains manganic chloride (see
R. J. Meyer, <i>Zeit. anorg. Chem.</i>, 1899, 22, p. 169; G. Neumann,
<i>Monats.</i>, 1894, 15, p. 489). It is almost impossible to prepare a pure
hydrated manganese dioxide owing to the readiness with which it
loses oxygen, leaving residues of the type <i>x</i>MnO·<i>y</i>MnO<span class="su">2</span>. Such mixtures
are obtained by the action of alkaline hypochlorites on manganous
salts, or by suspending manganous carbonate in water and passing
chlorine through the mixture. The solid matter is filtered off,
washed with water, and warmed with 10% nitric acid (A. Gorgen).
It is a dark brown powder, which reddens litmus. Manganese
dioxide combines with other basic oxides to form <i>manganites</i>, and
on this property is based the Weldon process for the recovery of
manganese from the waste liquors of the chlorine stills (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Chlorine</a></span>).
The manganites are amorphous brown solids, insoluble in water,
and decomposed by hydrochloric acid with the evolution of chlorine.
<i>Manganese trioxide</i>, MnO<span class="su">3</span>, is obtained in small quantity as an unstable
deliquescent red solid by dropping a solution of potassium
permanganate in sulphuric acid on to dry sodium carbonate (B.
Franke, <i>Jour. prak. Chem.</i>, 1887 [2], 36, p. 31). Above 50° C. it
decomposes into the dioxide and oxygen. It dissolves in water
forming manganic acid, H<span class="su">2</span>MnO<span class="su">4</span>. <i>Manganese heptoxide</i>, Mn<span class="su">2</span>O<span class="su">7</span>, prepared
by adding pure potassium permanganate to well cooled,
concentrated sulphuric acid, when the oxide separates as a dark oil
(H. Aschoff, <i>Pogg. Ann.</i>, 1860, 111, p. 217), is very unstable, continually
giving off oxygen. It decomposes violently on heating,
and explodes in contact with hydrogen, sulphur, phosphorus, &amp;c.
It dissolves in water to form a deep red solution which contains
<i>permanganic acid</i>, HMnO<span class="su">4</span>. This acid is also formed by decomposing
barium or lead permanganate with dilute sulphuric acid. It is
only known in aqueous solution. This solution is of a deep violet-red
colour, and is somewhat fluorescent; it decomposes on exposure
to light, or when heated. It is a monobasic acid, and a very powerful
oxidizing agent (M. M. P. Muir, <i>Jour. Chem. Soc.</i>, 1907, 91,
p. 1485).</p>

<p><i>Manganous Salts.</i>&mdash;The anhydrous <i>chloride</i>, MnCl<span class="su">2</span>, is obtained
as a rose-red crystalline solid by passing hydrochloric acid gas over
manganese carbonate, first in the cold and afterwards at a moderate
red heat. The hydrated chloride, MnCl<span class="su">2</span>·4H<span class="su">2</span>O, is obtained in
rose-red crystals by dissolving the metal or its carbonate in aqueous
hydrochloric acid and concentrating the solution. It may be
obtained in at least two different forms, one isomorphous with
NaCl·2H<span class="su">2</span>O, by concentrating the solution between 15° C. and 20°C.;
the other, isomorphous with FeCl<span class="su">2</span>·4H<span class="su">2</span>O, by slow evaporation of
the mother liquors from the former. It forms double salts with the
chlorides of the alkali metals. The <i>bromide</i> MnBr<span class="su">2</span>·4H<span class="su">2</span>O, <i>iodide</i>,
MnI<span class="su">2</span>, and <i>fluoride</i>, MnF<span class="su">2</span>, are known.</p>

<p><i>Manganous Sulphate</i>, MnSO<span class="su">4</span>, is prepared by strongly heating a
paste of pyrolusite and concentrated sulphuric acid until acid fumes
cease to be evolved. The ferric and aluminium sulphates present
are thus converted into insoluble basic salts, and the residue yields
manganous sulphate when extracted with water. The salt crystallizes
with varying quantities of water, according to the temperature
at which crystallization is effected: between &minus;4° C. and +6° C.
with 7H<span class="su">2</span>O, between 15° C. and 20° C. with 5H<span class="su">2</span>O, and between 25° C.
and 31° C. with 4H<span class="su">2</span>O. It crystallizes in large pink crystals, the
colour of which is probably due to the presence of a small quantity
of manganic sulphate or of a cobalt sulphate. It combines with the
sulphates of the alkali metals to form double salts.</p>

<p><i>Manganous Nitrate</i>, Mn(NO<span class="su">3</span>)<span class="su">2</span>·6H<span class="su">2</span>O, obtained by dissolving the
carbonate in nitric acid and concentrating the solution, crystallizes
from nitric acid solutions in long colourless needles, which melt at
25.8° C. and boil at 129.5° C. with some decomposition.</p>

<p><i>Manganous Carbonate</i>, MnCO<span class="su">3</span>, found native as manganese spar,
may be prepared as an amorphous powder by heating manganese
chloride with sodium carbonate in a sealed tube to 150° C., or in the
hydrated form as a white flocculent precipitate by adding sodium
carbonate to a manganous salt. In the moist condition it rapidly
turns brown on exposure to air.</p>

<p><i>Manganous Sulphide</i>, MnS, found native as manganese glance,
may be obtained by heating the monoxide or carbonate in a porcelain
tube in a current of carbon bisulphide vapour. R. Schneider
(<i>Pogg. Ann.</i>, 1874, 151, 449) obtained a crystalline variety by
melting sulphur with anhydrous manganous sulphate and dry
potassium carbonate, extracting the residue and drying it in a
current of hydrogen. Four sulphides are known; the red and green
are anhydrous, a grey variety contains much water, whilst the
pink is a mixture of the grey and red (J. C. Olsen and W. S. Rapalje,
<i>Jour. Amer. Chem. Soc.</i>, 1904, 26, p. 1615). Ammonium sulphide
alone gives incomplete precipitation of the sulphide. In the
presence of ammonium salts the precipitate is dirty white in colour,
whilst in the presence of free ammonia it is a buff colour. This
form of the sulphide is readily oxidized when exposed in the moist
condition, and is easily decomposed by dilute mineral acids.</p>

<p><i>Manganese Disulphide</i>, MnS<span class="su">2</span>, found native as hauerite, is formed
as a red coloured powder by heating manganous sulphate with
potassium polysulphide in a sealed tube at 160°-170° C. (H. v.
Senarmont, <i>Jour. prak. Chem.</i>, 1850, 51, p. 385).</p>

<p><i>Manganic Salts.</i>&mdash;The sulphate, Mn<span class="su">2</span>(SO<span class="su">4</span>)<span class="su">3</span>, is prepared by gradually
heating at 138° C. a mixture of concentrated sulphuric and
manganese dioxide until the whole becomes of a dark green colour.
The excess of acid is removed by spreading the mass on a porous
plate, the residue stirred for some hours with nitric acid, again spread
on a porous plate, and finally dried quickly at about 130° C. It is
a dark green deliquescent powder which decomposes on heating
or on exposure to moist air. It is readily decomposed by dilute
acids. With potassium sulphate in the presence of sulphuric acid
it forms potassium manganese alum, K<span class="su">2</span>SO<span class="su">4</span>·Mn<span class="su">2</span>(SO<span class="su">4</span>)<span class="su">2</span>·24H<span class="su">2</span>O.
A. Piccini (<i>Zeit. anorg. Chem.</i> 1898, 17, p. 355) has also obtained
a manganese caesium alum. <i>Manganic Fluoride</i>, MnF<span class="su">3</span>, a solid
obtained by the action of fluorine on manganous chloride, is decomposed
by heat into manganous fluoride and fluorine. By suspending
the dioxide in carbon tetrachloride and passing in hydrochloric
acid gas, W. B. Holmes (<i>Abst. J.C.S.</i>, 1907, ii., p. 873) obtained
a black trichloride and a reddish-brown tetrachloride.</p>

<p><i>Manganese Carbide</i>, Mn<span class="su">3</span>C, is prepared by heating manganous
oxide with sugar charcoal in an electric furnace, or by fusing
manganese chloride and calcium carbide. Water decomposes
it, giving methane and hydrogen (H. Moissan); Mn<span class="su">3</span>C + 6H<span class="su">2</span>O =
3Mn(OH)<span class="su">2</span> + CH<span class="su">4</span> + H<span class="su">2</span>.</p>

<p><i>Manganates.</i>&mdash;These salts are derived from manganic acid
H<span class="su">2</span>MnO<span class="su">4</span>. Those of the alkali metals are prepared by fusing manganese
dioxide with sodium or potassium hydroxide in the presence of
air or of some oxidizing agent (nitre, potassium chlorate, &amp;c.);
MnO<span class="su">2</span> + 2KHO + O = K<span class="su">2</span>MnO<span class="su">4</span> + H<span class="su">2</span>O. In the absence of air the
reaction proceeds slightly differently, some manganese sesquioxide
being formed; 3MnO<span class="su">2</span> + 2KHO = K<span class="su">2</span>MnO<span class="su">4</span> + Mn<span class="su">2</span>O<span class="su">3</span> + H<span class="su">2</span>O. The fused
mass has a dark olive-green colour, and dissolves in a small quantity
of cold water to a green solution, which is, however, only stable in
the presence of an excess of alkali. The green solution is readily
converted into a pink one of permanganate by a large dilution with
water, or by passing carbon dioxide through it: 3K<span class="su">2</span>MnO<span class="su">4</span> + 2CO<span class="su">2</span> =
2K<span class="su">2</span>CO<span class="su">3</span> + 2KMnO<span class="su">4</span> + MnO<span class="su">2</span>.</p>

<p><i>Permanganates</i> are the salts of permanganic acid, HMnO<span class="su">4</span>. The
<i>potassium</i> salt, KMnO<span class="su">4</span>, may be prepared by passing chlorine or
carbon dioxide through an aqueous solution of potassium manganate,
or by the electrolytic oxidation of the manganate at the anode
[German patent 101710 (1898)]. It crystallizes in dark purple-red
prisms, isomorphous with potassium perchlorate. It acts as a
powerful oxidizing agent, both in acid and alkaline solution; in the
first case two molecules yield five atoms of available oxygen and in
the second, three atoms:</p>

<p><i>Sodium Permanganate</i>, NaMnO<span class="su">4</span>.3H<span class="su">2</span>O (?), may be prepared in a
similar manner, or by precipitating the silver salt with sodium
chloride. It crystallizes with great difficulty. A solution of the crude
salt is used as a disinfectant under the name of &ldquo;Condy&rsquo;s fluid.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Ammonium Permanganate</i>, NH<span class="su">4</span>·MnO<span class="su">4</span>, explodes violently on
rubbing, and its aqueous solution decomposes on boiling (W. Muthmann,
<i>Ber.</i>, 1893, 26, p. 1018); NH<span class="su">4</span>·MnO<span class="su">4</span> = MnO<span class="su">2</span> + N<span class="su">2</span> + 2H<span class="su">2</span>O.</p>

<p><i>Barium Permanganate</i>, BaMn<span class="su">2</span>O<span class="su">3</span>, crystallizes in almost black
needles, and is formed by passing carbon dioxide through water
containing suspended barium manganate.</p>

<p><i>Detection.</i>&mdash;Manganese salts can be detected by the amethyst
colour they impart to a borax-bead when heated in the Bunsen
flame, and by the green mass formed when they are fused with a
mixture of sodium carbonate and potassium nitrate. Manganese
may be estimated quantitatively by precipitation as carbonate,
this salt being then converted into the oxide, Mn<span class="su">3</span>O<span class="su">4</span> by ignition;
or by precipitation as hydrated dioxide by means of ammonia and
bromine water, followed by ignition to Mn<span class="su">3</span>O<span class="su">4</span>. The valuation of
pyrolusite is generally carried out by means of a distillation with
hydrochloric acid, the liberated chlorine passing through a solution
of potassium iodide, and the amount of iodine liberated being
ascertained by means of a standard solution of sodium thiosulphate.</p>

<p>The atomic weight of manganese has been frequently determined.
J. Berzelius, by analysis of the chloride, obtained the value 54.86;
K. v. Hauer (<i>Sitzb. Akad. Wien.</i>, 1857, 25, p. 132), by conversion
of the sulphate into sulphide, obtained the value 54.78; J. Dewar
and A. Scott (<i>Chem. News</i>, 1883, 47, p. 98), by analysis of silver
permanganate, obtained the value 55.038; J. M. Weeren (<i>Stahl. u.</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page571" id="page571"></a>571</span>
<i>Eisen</i>, 1893, 13, p. 559), by conversion of manganous oxide into
the sulphate obtained the value 54.883, and of the sulphate into
sulphide the value 54.876 (H = 1), and finally G. P. Baxter and
Hines (<i>Jour. Amer. Chem. Soc.</i>, 1906, 28, p. 1360), by analyses of
the chloride and bromide, obtained 54.96 (O = 16).</p>

<p><span class="bold">MANGANITE,<a name="ar90" id="ar90"></a></span> a mineral consisting of hydrated manganese
sesquioxide, Mn<span class="su">2</span>O<span class="su">3</span>·H<span class="su">2</span>O, crystallizing in the orthorhombic system
and isomorphous with diaspore and göthite. Crystals are prismatic
and deeply striated parallel to their length; they are often
grouped together in bundles. The colour is dark steel-grey to
iron-black, and the lustre brilliant and submetallic: the streak
is dark reddish-brown. The hardness is 4, and the specific
gravity 4.3. There is a perfect cleavage
parallel to the brachypinacoid, and less
perfect cleavage parallel to the prism faces
<i>m</i>. Twinned crystals are not infrequent.
The mineral contains 89.7% of manganese
sesquioxide; it dissolves in hydrochloric
acid with evolution of chlorine. The best
crystallized specimens are those from Ilfeld
in the Harz, where the mineral occurs with
calcite and barytes in veins traversing
porphyry. Crystals have also been found at
Ilmenau in Thuringia, Neukirch near Schlettstadt
in Alsace (&ldquo;newkirkite&rdquo;), Granam near Towie in Aberdeenshire,
Upton Pyne near Exeter and Negaunee in Michigan.
As an ore of manganese it is much less abundant than pyrolusite
or psilomelane. The name manganite was given by W. Haidinger
in 1827: French authors adopt F. S. Beudant&rsquo;s name &ldquo;acerdèse,&rdquo;
(Gr. <span class="grk" title="âkerdês">&#7936;&#954;&#949;&#961;&#948;&#942;&#962;</span>, unprofitable) because the mineral is of little value
for bleaching purposes as compared with pyrolusite.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MANGBETTU<a name="ar91" id="ar91"></a></span> (<i>Monbuttu</i>), a negroid people of Central Africa
living to the south of the Niam-Niam in the Welle district of
Belgian Congo. They number about a million. Their country
is a table-land at an altitude of 2500 to 2800 ft. Despite its
abundant animal life, luxuriant vegetation and rich crops of
plantain and oil-palm, the Mangbettu have been some of the most
inveterate cannibals in Africa; but since the Congo State established
posts in the country (<i>c.</i> 1895) considerable efforts have
been made to stamp out cannibalism. Physically the Mangbettu
differ greatly from their negro neighbours. They are not so
black and their faces are less negroid, many having quite aquiline
noses. The beard, too, is fuller than in most negroes. They
appear to have imposed their language and customs on the
surrounding tribes, the Mundu, Abisanga, &amp;c. Once a considerable
power, they have practically disappeared as far as the
original stock is concerned; their language and culture, however,
remain, maintained by their subjects, with whom they have to a
large extent intermixed. The men wear bark cloth, the art of
weaving being unknown, the women a simple loin cloth, often
not that. Both sexes paint the body in elaborate designs. As
potters, sculptors, boatbuilders and masons the Mangbettu
have had few rivals in Africa. Their huts, with pointed roofs,
were not only larger and better built, but were cleaner than those
of their neighbours, and some of their more important buildings
were of great size and exhibited some skill in architecture.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MANGEL-WURZEL,<a name="ar92" id="ar92"></a></span> or field-beet, a variety of the common
beet, known botanically as <i>Beta vulgaris</i>, var. <i>macrorhiza</i>. The
name is German and means literally &ldquo;root of scarcity.&rdquo; R. C. A.
Prior (<i>Popular Names of British Plants</i>) says it was originally
mangold, a word of doubtful meaning. The so-called root consists
of the much thickened primary root together with the
&ldquo;hypocotyl,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> the original stem between the root and the
seed-leaves. A transverse section of the root shows a similar
structure to the beet, namely a series of concentric rings of
firmer &ldquo;woody&rdquo; tissue alternating with rings of soft thin-walled
parenchymatous &ldquo;bast-tissue&rdquo; which often has a crimson or
yellowish tint. The root is a store of carbohydrate food-stuff
in the form of sugar, which is formed in the first year of growth
when the stem remains short and bears a rosette of large leaves.
If the plant be allowed to remain in the ground till the following
year strong leafy angular aerial stems are developed, 3 ft. or
more in height, which branch and bear the inflorescences. The
flowers are arranged in dense sessile clusters subtended by a
small bract, and resemble those of the true beet. The so-called
seeds are clusters of spurious fruits. After fertilization the
fleshy receptacle and the base of the perianth of each flower
enlarge and the flowers in a cluster become united; the fleshy
parts with the ovaries, each of which contains one seed, become
hard and woody. Hence several seeds are present in one &ldquo;seed&rdquo;
of commerce, which necessitates the careful thinning of a young
crop, as several seedlings may spring from one &ldquo;seed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This plant is very susceptible of injury from frost, and hence
in the short summer of Scotland it can neither be sown so early
nor left in the ground so late as would be requisite for its mature
growth. But it is peculiarly adapted for those southern parts of
England where the climate is too hot and dry for the successful
cultivation of the turnip. In feeding quality it rivals the
swede; it is much relished by livestock&mdash;pigs especially doing
remarkably well upon it; and it keeps in good condition till
midsummer if required. The valuable constituent of mangel
is dry matter which averages about 12% as against 11% in
swedes. Of this two-thirds may be sugar, which only develops
fully during storage. Indeed, it is only after it has been some
months in the store heap that mangel becomes a palatable and
safe food for cattle. It is, moreover, exempt from the attacks
of the turnip beetle. On all these accounts, therefore, it is
peculiarly valuable in those parts of Great Britain where the
summer is usually hot and dry.</p>

<p>Up to the act of depositing the seed, the processes of preparation
for mangel are similar to those described for the turnip;
winter dunging being even more appropriate for the former than
for the latter. The common drilling machines are easily fitted
for sowing its large rough seeds, which should be sown from the
beginning of April to the middle of May and may be deposited
either on ridges or on the flat. The after culture is like that of
the turnip. The plants are thinned out at distances of not less
than 15 in. apart. Transplanting can be used for filling up of
gaps with more certainty of success than in the case of swedes,
but it is much more economical to avoid such gaps by sowing a
little swede seed along with the mangel. Several varieties of the
plant are cultivated&mdash;those in best repute being the long red,
the yellow globe and the tankard, intermediate in shape. This
crop requires a heavier dressing of manure than the turnip to
grow it in perfection, and is much benefited by having salt
mixed with the manure at the rate of 2 or 3 cwt. per acre. Nitrogenous
manures are of more marked value than phosphatic
manures. The crop requires to be secured in store heaps as
early in autumn as possible, as it is easily injured by frost.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MANGLE.<a name="ar93" id="ar93"></a></span> (1) A machine for pressing and smoothing clothes
after washing (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Laundry</a></span>). The word was adopted from the
Dutch; <i>mangel-stok</i> means a rolling pin, and <i>linnen mangelen</i>, to
press linen by rolling; similarly in O. Ital. <i>mangano</i> meant,
according to Florio, &ldquo;a presse to press buckrom,&rdquo; &amp;c. The
origin of the word is to be found in the medieval Latin name,
<i>manganum</i>, <i>mangonus</i> or <i>mangana</i>, for an engine of war, the
&ldquo;mangonel,&rdquo; for hurling stones and other missiles (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Catapult</a></span>).
The Latin word was adapted from the Greek <span class="grk" title="magganon">&#956;&#940;&#947;&#947;&#945;&#957;&#959;&#957;</span>,
a trick or device, cognate with <span class="grk" title="mêchanê">&#956;&#951;&#967;&#945;&#957;&#942;</span>, a machine. (2) To
cut in pieces, to damage or disfigure; to mutilate. This word is
of obscure origin. According to the <i>New English Dictionary</i>
it presents an Anglo-French <i>mahangler</i>, a form of <i>mahaigner</i>
from which the English &ldquo;maim&rdquo; is derived, cf. the old form
&ldquo;mayhem,&rdquo; surviving in legal phraseology. Skeat connects
the word with the Latin <i>mancus</i>, maimed, with which &ldquo;maim&rdquo;
is not cognate.</p>

It is the chief state of the Wa or Vü tribes, some of whom are
head-hunters, and Mang Lön is the only one which as yet has
direct relations with the British government. Estimated area,
3000 sq. m.; estimated population, 40,000. The state extends

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page572" id="page572"></a>572</span>
Salween. Its width varies greatly, from a mile or even less on
either side of the river to perhaps 40 m. at its broadest part near
Taküt, the capital. It is divided into East and West Mang Lön,
the boundary being the Salween. There are no Wa in West
Mang Lön. Shans form the chief population, but there are
Palaungs, Chinese and Yanglam, besides Lahu. The bulk of
the population in East Mang Lön is Wa, but there are many
Shans and Lahu. Both portions are very hilly; the only flat
land is along the banks of streams in the valleys, and here the
Shans are settled. There are prosperous settlements and bazaars
at Nawng Hkam and Möng Kao in West Mang Lön. The Wa
of Mang Lön have given up head-hunting, and many profess
Buddhism. The capital, Taküt, is perched on a hill-top 6000 ft.

She was a pupil and finally mistress of a school at Crofton Hall,

<p><span class="bold">MANGO.<a name="ar96" id="ar96"></a></span> The mango-tree (<i>Mangifera indica</i>, natural order
Anacardiaceae) is a native of tropical Asia, but is now extensively
cultivated in the tropical and subtropical regions of the
New as well as the Old World. It is indigenous in India at the
base of the Himalayas, and in Further India and the Andaman
Islands (see A. de Candolle, <i>Origin of Cultivated Plants</i>). The
cultivation of the fruit must have spread at an early age over the
Indian Peninsula, and it now grows everywhere in the plains.
It grows rapidly to a height of 30 to 40 ft., and its dense, spreading
and glossy foliage would secure its cultivation for the sake of its
shade and beauty alone. Its fruit, a drupe, though in the wild
variety (not to be confused with that of <i>Spondias mangifera</i>,
belonging to the same order, also called wild mango in India)
stringy and sour, from its containing much gallic acid, and with
a disagreeable flavour of turpentine, has become sweet and
luscious through culture and selection, to which we owe many
varieties, differing not only in flavour but also in size, from that
of a plum to that of an apple. When unripe, they are used to
make pickles, tarts and preserves; ripe, they form a wholesome
and very agreeable dessert. In times of scarcity the kernels
also are eaten. The timber, although soft and liable to decay,
serves for common purposes, and, mixed with sandal-wood, is
employed in cremation by the Hindus. It is usually propagated
by grafts, or by layering or inarching, rather than by seed.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MANGOSTEEN<a name="ar97" id="ar97"></a></span> (<i>Garcinia Mangostana</i>), a tree belonging to
the order Guttiferae. It is a native of the Malay Peninsula, and
is extensively cultivated in southern Tenasserim, and in some
places in the Madras presidency. Poor results have followed the
attempt to introduce it to other countries; and A. de Candolle
refers to it as one of the most local among cultivated plants both
in its origin, habitation and cultivation. It belongs to a family
in which the mean area of the species is very restricted. It is an
evergreen about 20 ft. high, and is somewhat fir-like in general
form, but the leaves are large, oval, entire, leathery and glistening.
Its fruit, the much-valued mangosteen, is about the size and shape
of an orange, and is somewhat similarly partitioned, but is of
a reddish-brown to chestnut colour. Its thick rind yields a very
astringent juice, rich in tannin, and containing a gamboge-like
resin. The soft and juicy pulp is snow-white or rose-coloured,
and of delicious flavour and perfume. It is wholesome, and may
be administered in fever.</p>

<p>The genus <i>Garcinia</i> is a genus of trees containing about fifty
species in the tropics of the Old World, and usually yielding a
yellow gum-resin (gamboge). <i>G. Morella</i>, a native of India,
yields the true gamboge.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MANGROVE.<a name="ar98" id="ar98"></a></span> The remarkable &ldquo;mangrove forests&rdquo; which
fringe tidal estuaries, overrun salt marshes, and line muddy
coasts in the tropics of both Old and New Worlds, are composed
of trees and shrubs belonging mainly to the Rhizophoraceae,
but including, especially in the eastern mangrove formations of
Further India and the Malay Archipelago, members of other
orders of Dicotyledons, such as Lythraceae (<i>Sonneratia</i>), Verbenaceae
(<i>Avicennia</i>), and the acaulescent Nipa-palm. Their
trunks and branches constantly emit adventitious roots, which,
descending in arched fashion, strike at some distance from the
parent stem, and send up new trunks, the forest thus spreading
like a banyan grove. An advantage in dispersal, very characteristic
of the order, is afforded by the seeds, which have a striking
peculiarity of germination. While the fruit is still attached to
the parent branch the long radicle emerges from the seed and
descends rapidly towards the mud, where it may even establish
itself before falling off. Owing to its clubbed shape, this is
always in the right position; the plumule then makes its appearance.
An interesting feature of the mangrove is the air-roots,
erect or kneed branches of the roots, which project above the mud,
and are provided with minute openings (stomata or lenticels),
into which the air passes and is then carried by means of passages
in the soft spongy tissue to the roots which spread beneath the
mud. The wood of some species is hard and durable, and the
astringent bark is used in tanning. The fruit of the common
mangrove, <i>Rhizophora Mangle</i>, is sweet and wholesome, and
yields a light wine.</p>

over the Balkan Peninsula, Italy, the Rhine-lands, Britain,
Spain and Latin Africa. It was peculiarly the religion of the
Roman garrisons, and was carried by the legionaries wherever
they went. It was an austere religion, inculcating self-restraint,
courage and honesty; it secured peace of conscience through forgiveness
of sins, and abated for those who were initiated in its
mysteries the superstitious terrors of death and the world to come.
In these respects it resembled Christianity. Soldiers may have
espoused it rather than the rival faith, because in the primitive
age Christian discipline denied them the sacraments, on the
ground that they were professional shedders of blood. The
cumbrous mythology and cosmogony of Mithraism at last
weakened its hold upon men&rsquo;s minds, and it disappeared during
the 4th century before a victorious Catholicism, yet not until
another faith, equally Iranian in its mythology and cosmological
beliefs, had taken its place. This new faith was that of Mani,
which spread with a rapidity only to be explained by supposing
that Mithraism had prepared men&rsquo;s minds for its reception.</p>

<p>Mani professed to blend the teachings of Christ with the old
Persian Magism. Kessler, the latest historian of Manichaeism,
opines that Mani&rsquo;s own declaration on this point is not to be
relied upon, and has tried to prove that it was rather of Semitic
or Chaldaic origin. He certainly shows that the old Assyrian
mythology influenced Mani, but not that this element did not
reach him through Persian channels. In genuine Manichaean
documents we only find the name Mani, but Manes, <span class="grk" title="Manês">&#924;&#940;&#957;&#951;&#962;</span>,
Manichaeus, meet us in 4th-century Greek and Latin documents.
In the <i>Acta Archelai</i> his first name is said to have been Cubricus,
which Kessler explains as a corruption of Shuravik, a name
common among the Arabs of the Syrian desert.</p>

<p><i>Life of Mani.</i>&mdash;According to the Mahommedan tradition,
which is more trustworthy than the account contained in these
<i>Acta</i>, Mani was a high-born Persian of Ecbatana. The year of
his birth is uncertain, but Kessler accepts as reliable the statement
made by Biruni, that Mani was born in the year 527 of the
astronomers of Babylon (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 215-216). He received a careful
education at Ctesiphon from his father Fatak, Babak or Patak
(<span class="grk" title="Patekios">&#928;&#945;&#964;&#941;&#954;&#953;&#959;&#962;</span>). As the father connected himself at a later period
with the confession of the <i>Moghtasilah</i>, or &ldquo;Baptists,&rdquo; in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page573" id="page573"></a>573</span>
southern Babylonia, the son also was brought up in the religious
doctrines and exercises of this sect. These Baptists (see the
<i>Fihrist</i>) were apparently connected with the Elkesaites and the
Hemerobaptists, and certainly with the Mandaeans. It is probable
that this Babylonian sect had absorbed Christian elements.
Thus the boy early became acquainted with very different
forms of religion. If even a small part of the stories about
his father is founded on fact, it was he who first introduced Mani
to that medley of religions out of which his system arose. Manichaean
tradition relates that Mani received revelations while
yet a boy, and assumed a critical attitude towards the religious
instruction that was being imparted to him. This is the more
incredible since the same tradition informs us that the boy was as
yet prohibited from making public use of his new religious views.
It was only when Mani had reached the age of twenty-five or
thirty years that he began to proclaim his new religion. This he
did at the court of the Persian king, Sh&#257;p&#363;r I., and, according
to the story, on the coronation day of that monarch (241/2).
A Persian tradition says that he had previously been a Christian
presbyter, but this is certainly incorrect. Mani did not remain
long in Persia, but undertook long journeys for the purpose of
spreading his religion, and also sent forth disciples. According
to the <i>Acta Archelai</i>, his missionary activity extended westwards
into the territory of the Christian church; but from
Oriental sources it is certain that Mani rather went into Transoxiana,
western China, and southwards as far as India. His
labours there as well as in Persia were not without result. Like
Mahomet after him and the founder of the Elkesaites before him,
he gave himself out for the last and highest prophet, who was to
surpass all previous divine revelation, which only possessed a
relative value, and to set up the perfect religion. In the closing
years of the reign of Sh&#257;p&#363;r I. (<i>c.</i> 270) Mani returned to the
Persian capital, and gained adherents even at court. But the
dominant priestly caste of the Magians, on whose support the
king was dependent, were naturally hostile to him, and after
some successes Mani was made a prisoner, and had then to flee.
The successor of Sh&#257;p&#363;r, H&#333;rmizd (272-273), appears to have
been favourably disposed towards him, but Bahr&#257;m I. abandoned
him to the fanaticism of the Magians, and caused him to be
crucified in the capital in the year 276/7. The corpse was
flayed, and Mani&rsquo;s adherents were cruelly persecuted by the
king.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Mani&rsquo;s Writings.</i>&mdash;Mani himself composed a large number of
works and epistles, which were in great part still known to the
Mahommedan historians, but are now mostly lost. The later
heads of the Manichaean churches also wrote religious treatises, so
that the ancient Manichaean literature must have been very extensive.
According to the <i>Fihrist</i>, Mani made use of the Persian
and Syriac languages; but, like the Oriental Marcionites before
him, he invented an alphabet of his own, which the <i>Fihrist</i> has
handed down to us. In this alphabet the sacred books of the
Manichaeans were written, even at a later period. The <i>Fihrist</i>
reckons seven principal works of Mani, six being in the Syriac and
one in the Persian language; regarding some of these we also have
information in Epiphanius, Augustine, Titus of Bostra, and Photius,
as well as in the formula of abjuration (Cotelerius, <i>PP. Apost. Opp.</i>
i. 543) and in the <i>Acta Archelai</i>. They are (1) <i>The Book of Secrets</i>
(see <i>Acta Archel.</i>), containing discussions bearing on the Christian
sects spread throughout the East, especially the Marcionites and
Bardesanites, and dealing also with their conception of the Old and
New Testaments; (2) <i>The Book of the Giants</i> (Demons?); (3) <i>The
Book of Precepts for Hearers</i> (probably identical with the <i>Epistola
Fundamenti</i> of Augustine and with the <i>Book of Chapters</i> of Epiphanius
and the <i>Acta Archelai</i>; this was the most widely spread and
most popular Manichaean work, having been translated into Greek
and Latin; it contained a short summary of all the doctrines of
fundamental authority); (4) <i>The Book Sh&#257;hp&#363;rak&#257;n</i> (Flügel was
unable to explain this name; according to Kessler it signifies &ldquo;epistle
to King Sh&#257;p&#363;r&rdquo;; the treatise was of an eschatological character);
(5) <i>The Book of Quickening</i> (Kessler identifies this work with the
&ldquo;Thesaurus [vitae]&rdquo; of the <i>Acta Archelai</i>, Epiphanius, Photius
and Augustine, and if this be correct it also must have been in use
among the Latin Manichaeans); (6) <i>The Book</i> <span class="grk" title="pragmateia">&#960;&#961;&#945;&#947;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#949;&#943;&#945;</span> (of unknown
contents); (7) a book in the Persian language, the title of
which is not given in our present text of the <i>Fihrist</i>, but which is
in all probability identical with the &ldquo;holy gospel&rdquo; of the Manichaeans
(mentioned in the <i>Acta Archel.</i> and many other authorities).
It was this work which the Manichaeans set up in opposition to the
Gospels. Besides these principal works, Mani also wrote a large
number of smaller treatises and epistles. The practice of writing
epistles was continued by his successors. These Manichaean dissertations
also became known in the Graeco-Roman Empire, and
existed in collections.<a name="fa1m" id="fa1m" href="#ft1m"><span class="sp">1</span></a> There also existed a Manichaean book of
memorabilia, and of prayers, in Greek, as well as many others,<a name="fa2m" id="fa2m" href="#ft2m"><span class="sp">2</span></a>
all of which were destroyed by the Christian bishops acting in conjunction
with the authorities. A Manichaean epistle, addressed
to one Marcellus, has, however, been preserved for us in the <i>Acta
Archelai</i>.<a name="fa3m" id="fa3m" href="#ft3m"><span class="sp">3</span></a></p>
</div>

<p><i>Manichaean System.</i>&mdash;Though the leading features of Manichaean
doctrine can be exhibited clearly even at the present
day, and though it is undoubted that Mani himself drew up
a complete system, many details are nevertheless uncertain,
since they are differently described in different sources, and
it often remains doubtful which of the accounts that have
been transmitted to us represents the original teaching of the
founder.</p>

<p>The Manichaean system is one of consistent, uncompromising
dualism, in the form of a fantastic philosophy of nature.
The physical and the ethical are not distinguished, and in
this respect the character of the system is thoroughly materialistic;
for when Mani co-ordinates good with light, and evil
with darkness, this is no mere figure of speech, but light is
actually good and darkness evil. From this it follows that
religious knowledge involves the knowledge of nature and
her elements, and that redemption consists in a physical process
of freeing the element of light from the darkness. Under
such circumstances ethics becomes a doctrine of abstinence
in regard to all elements which have their source within the
sphere of darkness.</p>

<p>The self-contradictory character of the present world forms
the point of departure for Mani&rsquo;s speculations. This contradiction
presents itself to his mind primarily as elemental, and
only in the second instance as ethical, inasmuch as he considers
the sensual nature of man to be the outflow of the evil elements
in nature. From the contradictory character of the world he
concludes the existence of two beings, originally quite separate
from each other&mdash;light and darkness. Each is to be thought
of according to the analogy of a kingdom. Light presents
itself to us as the good primal spirit (God, radiant with the
ten [twelve] virtues of love, faith, fidelity, high-mindedness,
wisdom, meekness, knowledge, understanding, mystery and
insight), and then further as the heavens of light and the earth
of light, with their guardians the glorious aeons. Darkness
is likewise a spiritual kingdom (more correctly, it also is conceived
of as a spiritual and feminine personification), but it
has no &ldquo;God&rdquo; at its head. It embraces an &ldquo;earth of darkness.&rdquo;
As the earth of light has five tokens (the mild zephyr, cooling
wind, bright light, quickening fire, and clear water), so has
the earth of darkness also five (mist, heat, the sirocco, darkness
and vapour). Satan with his demons was born from the kingdom
of darkness. These two kingdoms stood opposed to each other
from all eternity, touching each other on one side, but remaining
unmingled. Then Satan began to rage, and made an incursion
into the kingdom of light, into the earth of light. The God
of light, with his <i>syzygy</i>, &ldquo;the spirit of his right hand,&rdquo; now
begot the primal man, and sent him, equipped with the five
pure elements, to fight against Satan. But the latter proved
himself the stronger, and the primal man was for a moment
vanquished. And although the God of light himself now
took to the field, and with the help of new aeons (the spirit
of life, &amp;c.) inflicted total defeat upon Satan, and set the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page574" id="page574"></a>574</span>
primal man free; the latter had already been robbed of part
of his light by the darkness, and the five dark elements had
already mingled themselves with the generations of light.
It only remained now for the primal man to descend into the
abyss and prevent the further increase of the generations
of darkness by cutting off their roots; but he could not immediately
separate again the elements that had once mingled.
These mixed elements are the elements of the present visible
world, which was formed from them at the command of the
God of light. The forming of the world is in itself the beginning
of the deliverance of the imprisoned elements of light. The
world is represented as an orderly structure of various heavens
and various earths, which is borne and supported by the aeons,
the angels of light. It possesses in the sun and moon, which
are in their nature almost quite pure, large reservoirs, in which
the portions of light that have been rescued are stored up.
In the sun dwells the primal man himself, as well as the glorious
spirits which carry on the work of redemption; in the moon
the mother of life is enthroned. The twelve constellations
of the zodiac form an ingenious machine, a great wheel with
buckets, which pour into the sun and moon, those shining
ships that sail continually through space, the portions of light
set free from the world. Here they are purified anew, and
attain finally to the kingdom of pure light and to God
Himself. The later Western Manichaeans termed those portions
of light which are scattered throughout the world&mdash;in its
elements and organisms&mdash;awaiting their deliverance, the <i>Jesus
patibilis</i>.</p>

<p>It is significant of the materialistic and pessimistic character
of the system that, while the formation of the world is considered
as a work of the good spirits, the creation of man is
referred to the princes of darkness. The first man, Adam,
was engendered by Satan in conjunction with &ldquo;sin,&rdquo; &ldquo;cupidity,&rdquo;
&ldquo;desire.&rdquo; But the spirit of darkness drove into him
all the portions of light he had stolen, in order to be able to
dominate them the more securely. Hence Adam is a discordant
being, created in the image of Satan, but carrying within him
the stronger spark of light. Eve is given him by Satan as his
companion. She is seductive sensuousness, though also having
in her a small spark of light. But if the first human beings
thus stood entirely under the dominion of the devil, the glorious
spirits took them under their care from the very outset, sending
aeons down to them (including Jesus), who instructed them
regarding their nature, and in particular warned Adam against
sensuality. But this first man fell under the temptation of
sexual desire. Cain and Abel indeed are not sons of Adam,
but of Satan and Eve; Seth, however, who is full of light, is
the offspring of Adam by Eve. Thus did mankind come into
existence, its various members possessing very different shares
of light, but the men having uniformly a larger measure of it
than the women. In the course of history the demons sought
to bind men to themselves by means of sensuality, error and
false religions (among which is to be reckoned above all the
religion of Moses and the prophets), while the spirits of light
carried on their process of distillation with the view of gaining
the pure light which exists in the world. But these good
spirits can only save men by imparting to them the true <i>gnosis</i>
concerning nature and her forces, and by calling them away
from the service of darkness and sensuality. To this end
prophets, preachers of true knowledge, have been sent into
the world. Mani, following the example of the gnostic Jewish
Christians, appears to have held Adam, Noah, Abraham (perhaps
Zoroaster and Buddha) to be such prophets. Probably Jesus
was also accounted a prophet who had descended from the
world of light&mdash;not, however, the historical Jesus, the devilish
Messiah of the Jews, but a contemporaneous phantom Jesus,
who neither suffered nor died (<i>Jesus impatibilis</i>). According
to the teaching of some Manichaeans, it was the primal man
who disseminated the true gnosis in the character of Christ.
But at all events Mani himself, on his own claim, is to be reckoned
the last and greatest prophet, who took up the work of Jesus
impatibilis and of Paul (for he too finds recognition), and first
brought full knowledge. He is the &ldquo;leader,&rdquo; the &ldquo;ambassador
of the light,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Paraclete.&rdquo; It is only through his
agency and that of his imitators, &ldquo;the elect,&rdquo; that the separation
of the light from the darkness can be completed. The system
contains very fantastic descriptions of the processes by which
the portions of light when once set free finally ascend even to
the God of light. He who during his lifetime did not become
one of the elect, who did not completely redeem himself, has
to go through a severe process of purification on the other side
of the grave, till he too is gathered to the blessedness of the
light. It is erroneous, however, to ascribe, as has been done,
a doctrine of transmigration to the Manichaeans. Of course
men&rsquo;s bodies as well as the souls of the unsaved, who according
to the oldest conception have in them no light whatever, fall
under the sway of the powers of darkness. A later view,
adapted to the Christian one, represents the portions of light
in the unsaved as actually becoming lost. When the elements
of light have at last been completely, or as far as possible,
delivered from the world, the end of all things comes. All
glorious spirits assemble, the God of light himself appears,
accompanied by the aeons and the perfected just ones. The
angels supporting the world withdraw themselves from their
burden, and everything falls in ruins. A tremendous conflagration
consumes the world; the perfect separation of the
two powers takes place once more; high above is the kingdom
of light, again brought into a condition of completeness, and
deep below is the (? now powerless) darkness.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Ethics, Social Polity and Worship of the Manichaeans.</i>&mdash;On the
basis of such a cosmical philosophy, ethics can only have a dualistic
ascetic character. Manichaean ethics is not merely negative, however,
since it is necessary to cherish, strengthen and purify the
elements of light, as well as free oneself from the elements of darkness.
The aim is not self-destruction, but self-preservation; and
yet the ethics of Manichaeism appears in point of fact as thoroughly
ascetic. The Manichaean had, above all, to refrain from sensual
enjoyment, shutting himself up against it by three seals&mdash;the <i>signaculum
oris</i>, <i>manus</i> and <i>sinus</i>. The <i>signaculum oris</i> forbids all
eating of unclean food (which included all bodies of animals, wine,
&amp;c.&mdash;vegetable diet being allowed because plants contained more
light, though the killing of plants, or even plucking their fruit and
breaking their twigs, was not permitted), as well as all impure
speech. The <i>signaculum manus</i> prohibits all traffic with things
generally, in so far as they carry in them elements of darkness.
Finally, by the <i>signaculum sinus</i> every gratification of sexual desire,
and hence also marriage, are forbidden. Besides all this, life was
further regulated by an exceedingly rigorous system of fasts.
Certain astronomical conjunctions determined the selection of the
fast-days, which in their total number amounted to nearly a quarter
of the year. Sunday was regularly solemnized as one, and the
practice was also generally observed on Monday. Hours of prayer
were determined with equal exactness. The Manichaean had to
pray four times a day, each prayer being preceded by ablutions.
The worshipper turned towards the sun, or the moon, or the north,
as the seat of light; but it is erroneous to conclude from this, as has
been done, that in Manichaeism the sun and moon were themselves
objects of worship. Forms of prayer used by the Manichaeans
have been preserved to us in the <i>Fihrist</i>. The prayers are addressed
to the God of light, to the whole kingdom of light, to the glorious
angels, and to Mani himself, who is apostrophized in them as &ldquo;the
great tree, which is all salvation.&rdquo; According to Kessler, these
prayers are closely related to the Mandaean and the ancient Babylonian
hymns. An asceticism so strict and painful as that demanded
by Manichaeism could only be practised by few; hence the religion
must have abandoned all attempts at an extensive propaganda
had it not conceded the principle of a twofold morality. A distinction
was made in the community between the <i>electi</i> (<i>perfecti</i>),
the perfect Manichaeans, and the <i>catechumeni</i> (<i>auditores</i>), the secular
Manichaeans. Only the former submitted themselves to all the
demands made by their religion; for the latter the stringency of the
precepts was relaxed. They had to avoid idolatry, sorcery, avarice,
falsehood, fornication, &amp;c.; above all, they were not allowed to
kill any living being (the ten commandments of Mani). They had
also to free themselves as much as possible from the world; but in
truth they lived very much as their non-Manichaean fellow-citizens.
We have here essentially the same condition of things as in the
Catholic Church, where a twofold morality was also in force, that
of the religious orders and that of secular Christians&mdash;only that
the position of the electi in Manichaeism was a more distinguished
one than that of the monks in Catholicism. For, after all,
the Christian monks never quite forgot that salvation is given by
God through Christ, whereas the Manichaean <i>electi</i> were actually
themselves redeemers. Hence it was the duty of the <i>auditores</i>
to pay the greatest respect and most assiduous attention to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page575" id="page575"></a>575</span>
<i>electi</i>. These &ldquo;perfect ones,&rdquo; wasting away under their asceticism,
were objects of admiration and of the most elaborate solicitude.<a name="fa4m" id="fa4m" href="#ft4m"><span class="sp">4</span></a>
Food was presented to them in abundance, and by their eating it
the <i>electi</i> set free the portions of light from the vegetables. They
prayed for the <i>auditores</i>, they blessed them and interceded for them,
thereby shortening the process of purification the latter had to
pass through after death. It was only the <i>electi</i>, too, who possessed
full knowledge of religious truths, a point of distinction from
Catholicism.</p>

<p>The distinction between <i>electi</i> and <i>auditores</i>, however, does not
exhaust the conception of the Manichaean Church; on the contrary,
the latter possessed a hierarchy of three ranks, so that there were
altogether five gradations in the community. These were regarded
as a copy of the ranks of the kingdom of light. At the head stood
the <i>teachers</i> (&ldquo;the sons of meekness,&rdquo; Mani himself and his successors);
then follow the <i>administrators</i> (&ldquo;the sons of knowledge,&rdquo;
the bishops); then the <i>elders</i> (&ldquo;the sons of understanding,&rdquo; the
presbyters); the <i>electi</i> (&ldquo;the sons of mystery&rdquo;); and finally the
<i>auditores</i> (&ldquo;the sons of insight&rdquo;). The number of the <i>electi</i> must
always have been small. According to Augustine the teachers
were twelve and the bishops seventy-two in number. One of the
teachers appears to have occupied the position of superior at the
head of the whole Manichaean Church. At least Augustine speaks
of such a personage, and the <i>Fihrist</i> also has knowledge of a chief
of all Manichaeans. The constitution, therefore, had a monarchic
head.</p>

<p>The worship of the Manichaeans must have been very simple,
and must have essentially consisted of prayers, hymns and ceremonies
of adoration. This simple service promoted the secret
dissemination of their doctrines. The Manichaeans too, at least
in the West, appear to have adapted themselves to the Church&rsquo;s
system of festivals. The <i>electi</i> celebrated special feasts; but the
principal festival with all classes was the <i>Bema</i> (<span class="grk" title="bêma">&#946;&#8134;&#956;&#945;</span>), the feast
of the &ldquo;teacher&rsquo;s chair,&rdquo; held in commemoration of the death of
Mani in the month of March. The faithful prostrated themselves
before an adorned but empty chair, which was raised upon a podium
of five steps. Long fasts accompanied the feasts. The Christian
and Mahommedan historians could learn little of the Manichaean
mysteries and &ldquo;sacraments,&rdquo; and hence the former charged them
with obscene rites and abominable usages. It may be held as
undoubted that the later Manichaeans celebrated mysteries analogous
to Christian baptism and the Lord&rsquo;s Supper, which may
have rested upon ancient consecration rites and other ceremonies
instituted by Mani himself and having their origin in nature worship.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Recent Discoveries.</i>&mdash;F. Cumont (<i>Revue d&rsquo;histoire et de littérature
religieuse</i>, t. xii., 1907, No. 2) showed that one at least
of the fundamental myths of Mani was borrowed from the
Avesta, namely, that which recounts how through the manifestation
of the virgin of light and of the messenger of salvation
to the libidinous princes of darkness the vital substance or
light held captive in their limbs was liberated and recovered
for the realm of light. The legend of the <i>Omophorus</i> and
<i>Splenditeneus</i>, rival giants who sustain earth and luminous
heavens on their respective shoulders, even if it already figures
in the cuneiform texts of Assyria, is yet to be traced in Mithraic
bas-reliefs. It also may therefore have come to Mani through
Magian channels.</p>

<p>When, however, we turn to the numerous fragments of authentic
Manichaean liturgies and hymns lately discovered in Turfan
in East Turkestan, Mani&rsquo;s direct indebtedness to the cycle of
Magian legends rather than to Chaldaic sources (as Kessler
argued) is clearly exhibited.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>In fr. 472, taken from the Sh&#257;p&#363;rak&#257;n, as part of a description
of the sun-god in his ship or reservoir the sun, we have a mention
of &#256;z and Ahriman and the devas (demons), the Pairikas. &#256;z in
the Avestan mythology was the demon serpent who murders
Gayomert in the old Persian legend, and an ally of Ahriman, as also
are the <i>Pairikas</i> or Peris. In the same fragment we read of the
ruin of <i>A&#382;idah&#257;ka M&#257;zainya</i>, which name Darmesteter interprets
in the Persian sources as the demon serpent, the sorcerer (<i>Ormazd
et Ahriman</i>, Paris, 1877, p. 157). In fr. 470, descriptive of the
conflagration of the world, we read of how, after &#256;z and the demons
have been struck down, the pious man is purified and led up to sun
and moon and to the being of Ahura Mazda, the Divine.</p>

<p>In another fragment (388) of a hymn Mani describes himself as
&ldquo;the first stranger&rdquo; (cf. Matt. xxv. 43), the son of the god Zarv&#257;n,
the Ruler-Child. In the orthodox literature of fire-worship Zarv&#257;n
was Time or Destiny. Later on Zarv&#257;n was elevated to the position
of supreme principle, creator of Ormazd and Ahriman, and, long
before Mani, Zarv&#257;n accompanied Mithras in all his westward
migrations.</p>

<p>In fr. 20, in an enumeration of angels, we hear of Narsus, who may
be the N&#275;ry&#333;sang (Armenian Nerses or Narsai) of the Avesta.
The other angels are Jacob, the mighty angel and leader of angels,
the Lord Bar Sim&#363;s, Qaftinus the mighty, Raphael, Gabriel, Michael,
Sarael and Nastikus&mdash;a truly Catholic list.</p>

<p>In fr. 4 a rubric enjoins the recital of the hymn of the <i>Fra&#353;&#275;g&#275;rd</i>.
Here we recognize a technical term of the Avesta&mdash;namely, the
&ldquo;Frash&#333;-kereti,&rdquo; that is the reanimation of the world or resurrection
of the dead (Darmesteter, <i>op. cit.</i>, p. 239). In this hymn we
read how the gods shall release us from this sinful time, from the
oppression of this world. In fr. 4, under the rubric Bar Sim&#363;s,
we find the god Mihir (M&#299;&#7717;ryazd), the liberator, the compassionate,
invoked along with Fr&#275;d&#333;n, the good; and later on we read as follows:
&ldquo;with his mighty glance may the god of pure name, Pr&#275;d&#333;n, the
king and Jacob Nar&#275;man, protect religion and us the sons.&rdquo; Mihr
or Mithras and F&#275;ridoun or Thra&#275;taona, the slayer of Ajis (or Azi)
Dah&#257;ka, also Nar&#299;m&#257;n, spelled Nairimanau, are familiar figures in
the old Persian pantheon. In the same prayer the votary begs
that &ldquo;new blessing may come, new victory from the god Zarv&#257;n
over the glories and angels, the spirits of this world, to the end
that he accept our holy religion, become a watcher within and
without, helper and protector,&rdquo; and the prayer ends thus: &ldquo;I
invoke the angels, the strong ones, the mighty, Raphael, Michael,
Gabriel, Sarael, who shall protect us from all adversity, and free
us from the wicked Ahriman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In fr. 176 Jesus is invoked: &ldquo;Jesus, of the gods first new moon,
thou art God.... Jesus, O Lord, of waxing fame full moon,
O Jesus. Lord ... light, our hearts&rsquo; prayer. Jesus, God and
Vahman. Sheen God! We will praise the God Nar&#275;saf. M&#257;r
M&#257;n&#299; will we bless. O new moon and spring. Lord, we will bless.
The angels, the gods ... New sun, Mihr.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the above Vahman is Vohu Man&#333;, the good thought or inspiration
of the Zoroastrian religion. Mihr is Mithras. The god Nar&#275;saf
is also invoked in other fragments.</p>

<p>In fr. 74 is invoked, together with Jesus and Mani, the &ldquo;strong
mighty Zr&#333;sch, the redeemer of souls.&rdquo; In the Avesta Sraosha is
the angel that guards the world at night from demons, and is styled
&ldquo;the righteous&rdquo; or &ldquo;the strong.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fr. 38 is as follows: &ldquo;Mithras (MS. M&#299;tr&#257;) great ... messenger
of the gods, mediator (or interpreter) of religion, of the elect one
Jesus&mdash;virgin of light. M&#257;r M&#257;n&#299;, Jesus&mdash;virgin of light, M&#257;r
M&#257;n&#299;. Do thou in me make peace, O light-bringer, mayest thou
redeem my soul from this born-dead (existence).&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fr. 543 runs thus: &ldquo;... and ladder of the Mazdean faith.
Thou, new teacher of Chorasan (of the East), and promoter of
those that have the good faith. For thou wast born under a
glittering star in the family of the rulers. Elect are these&mdash;Jesus
and Vahman.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>The above examples bear out Mani&rsquo;s own declaration, as
reported by the <i>Fihrist</i>, that his faith was a blend of the old
Magian cult with Christianity. Whether the Hebrew names
of angels came to him direct from the Jews or not we cannot
tell, but they were, as the Greek magical papyri prove, widely
diffused among the Gentiles long before his age. The Armenian
writer Eznik (<i>c.</i> 425) also attests that Mani&rsquo;s teaching was
merely that of the Magi, <i>plus</i> an ascetic morality, for which
they hated and slew him.</p>

<p>Just as the background of Christianity was formed by the
Hebrew scriptures, and just as the Hebrew legends of the
creation became the basis of its scheme of human redemption
from evil, so the Avesta, with its quaint cosmogony and myths,
formed the background of Mani&rsquo;s new faith. He seems to have
quarrelled with the later Magism because it was not dualistic
enough, for in fr. 28 we have such a passage as the following:
&ldquo;They also that adore the fire, the burning, by this they themselves
recognize that their end shall be in fire. And they say
that Ormuzd and Ahriman are brothers, and in consequence of
this saying they shall come to annihilation.&rdquo; In the same
fragment the Christians are condemned as worshippers of
idols, unless indeed the writer has genuine pagans in view.
There is a mention of Marcion in the same context, but it is
unintelligible. There can be no doubt that in the form in
which Mani became acquainted with it Christianity had been
disengaged and liberated from the womb of Judaism which
gave it birth. This presentation of it as an ethical system
of universal import was the joint work of Paul and Marcion.</p>

<p>It remains to add that in these newly found fragments Mani
styles himself &ldquo;the apostle (<i>lit.</i> the sent forth) of Jesus the
friend in the love of the Father, of God.&rdquo; He uses the formula:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page576" id="page576"></a>576</span>
&ldquo;Praise and laud to the Father and the Son and the Holy
Spirit.&rdquo; In fr. 4 he attests that he was sprung from the
land Babel; in fr. 566 that he was a physician from the land
Babel. Fr. 3 recounts his interview with King Sh&#257;p&#363;r I. The
Gospel of Peter seems to have been in use, for one lengthy
citation is taken from it in fr. 18. The Manichaeans of Chinese
Turkestan also used a version of the <i>Shepherd</i> of Hermas.
Several of the hymns (<i>e.g.</i> in fr. 7 and 32) reproduce the ideas
and almost the phases of the Syriac &ldquo;Hymn of the Soul,&rdquo;
so confirming the hypothesis that Mani was influenced by
Bardesanes.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>With the exception of a few fragments written in a Pehlevi
dialect, all this recovered Manichaean literature is in the Ouigour
or Vigur dialect of Tatar. The alphabet used is the one adapted
by Mani himself from the Syriac estrangelo. The fragments are
800 in number, both on paper and vellum, written and adorned
with the pious care and good taste which the Manichaeans are
known to have bestowed on their manuscripts. They were brought
back by Professor Grünwedel and Dr Huth from Turfan in East
Turkestan, and were partly translated by Dr F. W. K. Müller in the
<i>Abhandtungen der k. preuss. Akademie der Wissenschaften</i> (Berlin,
1904). Much of this literature is still left in Turfan, where the
natives use the sheets of Vigur and Chinese vellum MSS. as window-panes
in their huts. The Russian and German governments have
sent out fresh expeditions to rescue what is left before it is too late.
We may thus hope to recover some priceless monuments of early
Christianity, hymns and treatises perhaps of Marcion and Bardesanes,
the Gospel of Peter, and even the Diatessaron. Müller&rsquo;s translations
includes a long extract of Mani&rsquo;s book called <i>Sch&#257;p&#363;rak&#257;n</i>, parts of
his <i>Evangelium</i>, and epistles, with liturgies, hymns and prayers,
for Tatar Kh&#257;ns who espoused the faith in Khorasan.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Manichaeism and Christianity.</i>&mdash;It is very difficult to determine
what was the extent of Mani&rsquo;s knowledge of Christianity,
how much he himself borrowed from it, and through what
channels it reached him. It is certain that Manichaeism, in
those districts where it was brought much into contact with
Christianity, became additionally influenced by the latter
at a very early period. The Western Manichaeans of the
4th and 5th centuries are much more like Christians than
their Eastern brethren. In this respect Manichaeism experienced
the same kind of development as Neo-Platonism.
As regards Mani himself, it is safest to assume that he held
both Judaism and Catholic Christianity to be entirely false
religions. It is indeed true that he not only described himself
as the promised Paraclete&mdash;for this designation probably
originated with himself&mdash;but also conceded a high place in
his system to &ldquo;Jesus&rdquo;; we can only conclude from this, however,
that he distinguished between Christianity and Christianity.
The religion which had proceeded from the historical
Jesus he repudiated together with its founder, and Catholicism
as well as Judaism he looked upon as a religion of the devil.
But he distinguished between the Jesus of darkness and the
Jesus of light who had lived and acted contemporaneously
with the former. This distinction agrees with that made
by the gnostic Basilides no less strikingly than the Manichaean
criticism of the Old Testament does with that propounded by
the Marcionites (see the <i>Acta Archelai</i>, in which Mani is made
to utter the antitheses of Marcion). Finally, the Manichaean
doctrines exhibit points of similarity to those of the Christian
Elkesaites. The historical relation of Mani to Christianity
is then as follows. From Catholicism, which he very probably
had no detailed knowledge of, he borrowed nothing,
rejecting it as devilish error. On the other hand, he looked
upon what he considered to be Christianity proper&mdash;that is,
Christianity as it had been developed among the sects of Basilidians,
Marcionites, and perhaps Bardesanites, as a comparatively
valuable and sound religion. He took from it the moral
teaching of the Sermon on the Mount, and a criticism of the
Old Testament and of Judaism so far as he required it. Indications
of the influence of Marcionitism are found in the high
estimation in which Mani held the apostle Paul, and in the
fact that he explicitly rejects the Book of Acts. Mani appears
to have given recognition to a portion of the historical matter
of the Gospels, and to have interpreted it in accordance with
his own doctrine.</p>

<p><i>Manichaeism and Buddhism.</i>&mdash;It remains to be asked whether
Buddhistic elements can also be detected in Manichaeism.
Most modern scholars since F. C. Baur have answered this
question in the affirmative. According to Kessler, Mani made
use of the teaching of Buddha, at least as far as ethics was
concerned. It cannot be doubted that Mani, who undertook
long journeys as far as India, knew of Buddhism. The name
Buddha (Buddas) which occurs in the legendary account of
Mani, and perhaps in the latter&rsquo;s own writings, indicates further
that he had occupied his attention with Buddhism when engaged
in the work of founding his new religion. But his borrowings
from this source must have been quite insignificant. A detailed
comparison shows the difference between Buddhism and Manichaeism
in all their principal doctrines to be very great, while
it becomes evident that the points of resemblance are almost
everywhere accidental. This is also true of the ethics and
the asceticism of the two systems. There is not a single point
in Manichaeism which demands for its explanation an appeal
to Buddhism. Such being the case, the relationship between
the two religions remains a mere possibility, a possibility which
the inquiry of Geyler (<i>Das System des Manichaeismus und
sein Verhältniss zum Buddhismus</i>, Jena, 1875) has not been
able to elevate into a probability.</p>

<p><i>The Secret of Manichaeism.</i>&mdash;How are we to explain the
rapid spread of Manichaeism, and the fact that it really became
one of the great religions? What gave it strength was that
it united an ancient mythology and a thorough-going materialistic
dualism with an exceedingly simple spiritual worship
and a strict morality. On comparing it with the Semitic
religions of nature we perceive that it was free from their
sensuous <i>cultus</i>, substituting instead a spiritual worship as
well as a strict morality. Manichaeism was thus able to satisfy
the new wants of an old world. It offered revelation, redemption,
moral virtue and immortality, spiritual benefits on the
basis of the religion of nature. A further source of strength
lay in the simple yet firm social organization which was given
by Mani himself to his new institution. The wise man and
the ignorant, the enthusiast and the man of the world, could
all find acceptance here, and there was laid on no one more
than he was able and willing to bear. Each one, however,
was attached and led onward by the prospect of a higher rank
to be attained, while the intellectually gifted had an additional
inducement in the assurance that they did not require to submit
themselves to any authority, but would be led to God by pure
reason. Thus adapted from the first to individual requirements,
this religion also showed itself able to appropriate from
time to time foreign elements. Originally furnished from
fragments of various religions, it could increase or diminish
this possession without rupturing its own elastic framework.
And, after all, great adaptability is just as necessary for a
universal religion as a divine founder in whom the highest
revelation of God may be seen and reverenced. Manichaeism
indeed, though it applies the title &ldquo;redeemer&rdquo; to Mani, has
really no knowledge of a redeemer, but only of a physical and
gnostic process of redemption; on the other hand, it possesses
in Mani the supreme prophet of God. If we consider in conclusion
that Manichaeism gave a simple, apparently profound,
and yet convenient solution of the problem of good and evil,
a problem that had become peculiarly oppressive to the human
race in the 2nd and 3rd centuries, we shall have named the
most important factors which account for the rapid spread
of the system.</p>

<p><i>Sketch of the History of Manichaeism.</i>&mdash;Manichaeism first
gained a firm footing in the East, <i>i.e.</i> in Persia, Mesopotamia
and Transoxiana. The persecutions it had to endure did not
hinder its extension. The seat of the Manichaean pope was
for centuries in Babylon, at a later period in Samarkand. Even
after the conquests of Islam the Manichaean Church continued to
maintain itself, indeed it seems to have become still more widely
diffused by the victorious campaigns of the Mahommedans,
and it frequently gained secret adherents among the latter
themselves. Its doctrine and discipline underwent little change
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page577" id="page577"></a>577</span>
in the East; in particular, it drew no nearer to the Christian
religion. More than once, however, Manichaeism experienced
attempts at reformation; for of course the <i>auditores</i> very easily
became worldly in character, and movements of reformation
led temporarily to divisions and the formation of sects. Towards
the close of the 10th century, at the time the <i>Fihirst</i> was written,
the Manichaeans in Mesopotamia and Persia had already been
in large measure ousted from the towns, and had withdrawn
to the villages. But in Turkestan, and as far as the Chinese
frontier, there existed numerous Manichaean communities
and even whole tribes that had adopted the name of Mani.
Probably it was the great migrations of the Mongolian race
that first put an end to Manichaeism in Central Asia. But even
in the 15th century there were Manichaeans living beside the
Thomas-Christians on the coast of Malabar in India (see Germann,
<i>Die Thomas-Christen</i>, 1875). Manichaeism first penetrated
the Greek-Roman Empire about the year 280, in the time of
the emperor Probus (see the <i>Chronicon</i> of Eusebius). If we
may take the edict of Diocletian against the Manichaeans
as genuine, the system must have gained a firm footing in the
West by the beginning of the 4th century, but we know that
as late as about the year 325 Eusebius had not any accurate
knowledge of the sect. It was only subsequent to about 330
that Manichaeism spread rapidly in the Roman Empire. Its
adherents were recruited on the one hand from the old gnostic
sects (especially from the Marcionites&mdash;Manichaeism exerted
besides this a strong influence on the development of the Marcionite
churches of the 4th century), on the other hand from
the large number of the &ldquo;cultured,&rdquo; who were striving after
a &ldquo;rational&rdquo; and yet in some manner Christian religion. Its
polemics and its criticism of the Catholic Church now became
the strong side of Manichaeism, especially in the West. It
admitted the stumbling-blocks which the Old Testament
offers to every intelligent reader, and gave itself out as a Christianity
without the Old Testament. Instead of the subtle
Catholic theories concerning divine predestination and human
freedom, and instead of a difficult theodicaea, it offered an
exceedingly simple conception of sin and goodness. The doctrine
of the incarnation of God, which was especially objectionable
to those who were going over to the new universal religion
from the old cults, was not proclaimed by Manichaeism. In its
rejection of this doctrine Manichaeism agreed with Neo-Platonism;
but, while the latter, notwithstanding all its attempts
to conform itself to Christianity, could find no formula by
which to inaugurate within its own limits the special veneration
of Christ, the Western Manichaeans succeeded in giving their
teaching a Christian tinge. The only part of the Manichaean
mythology that became popular was the crude, physical
dualism. The barbaric elements were judiciously screened
from view as a &ldquo;mystery&rdquo;; they were, indeed, here and there
explicitly disavowed even by the initiated. The farther
Manichaeism advanced into the West the more Christian and
philosophic did it become. In Syria it maintained itself in comparative
purity. In North Africa it found its most numerous
adherents, gaining secret support even among the clergy.
Augustine was an <i>auditor</i> for nine years, while Faustus was
at that time the most esteemed Manichaean teacher in the
West. Augustine in his later writings against the Manichaeans
deals chiefly with the following problems: (1) the relation
between knowledge and faith, and between reason and authority;
(2) the nature of good and evil, and the origin of the
latter; (3) the existence of free will, and its relation to the
divine omnipotence; (4) the relation of the evil in the world
to the divine government.</p>

<p>The Christian Byzantine and Roman emperors, from Valens
onwards, enacted strict laws against the Manichaeans. But
at first these bore little fruit. The <i>auditores</i> were difficult to
trace out, and besides they really gave little occasion for persecution.
In Rome itself between 370 and 440 Manichaeism
gained a large amount of support, especially among the scholars
and public teachers. It also made its way into the life of
the people by means of a popular literature in which the apostles
were made to play a prominent part (<i>Apocryphal Acts of the
Apostles</i>). Manichaeism in the West had also some experience
of attempts at reformation from the ascetic side, but of these
we know little. In Rome Leo the Great was the first who
took energetic measures, along with the state authorities,
against the system. Valentinian III. decreed banishment
against its adherents, Justinian the punishment of death.
In North Africa Manichaeism appears to have been extinguished
by the persecution of the Vandals. But it still continued to
exist elsewhere, both in the Byzantine Empire and in the West,
and in the earlier part of the middle ages it gave an impulse
to the formation of new sects, which remained related to it.
And if it has not been quite proved that so early as the
4th century the Priscillianists of Spain were influenced by
Manichaeism, it is at least undoubted that the Paulicians and
Bogomiles, as well as the Catharists and the Albigenses, are to
be traced back to Manichaeism (and Marcionitism). Thus the
system, not indeed of Mani the Persian, but of Manichaeism
as modified by Christian influences, accompanied the Catholic
Church until the 13th century.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Sources.</i>&mdash;(<i>a</i>) Oriental. Among the sources for a history of
Manichaeism the most important are the Oriental. Of these the
Mahommedan, though of comparatively late date, are distinguished
by the excellent manner in which they have been transmitted to
us, as well as by their impartiality. They must be named first,
because ancient Manichaean writings have been used in their construction.
At the head of all stands En-Ned&#299;m, <i>Fihrist</i> (<i>c.</i> 980),
ed. by Flügel (1871-1872); cf. the latter&rsquo;s work <i>Mani, seine Lehre
u. seine Schriften</i> (1862). See also Shahrast&#257;n&#299;, <i>Kitab al-milal wan-nu&#7717;al</i>
(12th cent.), ed. by Cureton (1846) and translated into German
by Haarbrücker (1851), and individual notes and excerpts by Tabar&#299;
(10th cent.), Al-B&#299;r&#363;n&#299; (11th cent.), and other Arabian and Persian
historians. Next come the Turfan fragments described in the
body of this article. See also W. Brandt, <i>Schriften aus der Genza
oder Sidv&#257; Rabba</i> (Göttingen, 1893).</p>

<p>Of the Christian Orientals those that afford most information
are Ephraem Syrus (d. 373), in various writings; the Armenian
Esnik (German translation by J. M. Schmid, Vienna, 1900, see also
<i>Zeitsch. f. hist. Theol.</i>, 1840, ii.; Langlois, <i>Collection</i>, ii. 375 seq.), who
wrote in the 5th century against Marcion and Mani; and the Alexandrian
patriarch Eutychius (d. 916), <i>Annales</i>, ed. Pococke (1628).
There are, besides, scattered pieces of information in Aphraates
(4th cent.), Barhebraeus (13th cent.) and others. The newly found
Syriac <i>Book of Scholia</i> of Theodor bar Khouni (see Pognon, <i>Les
Coupes de Kouabir</i>, Paris, 1898) gives many details about Mani&rsquo;s
teaching (also ed. without translation by Dr M. Lewin, Berlin, 1905).</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Greek and Latin. The earliest mention of the Manichaeans
in the Graeco-Roman Empire is to be found in an edict of Diocletian
(see Hänel, <i>Cod. Gregor.</i>, tit. xv.), which is held by some to be
spurious, while others assign it to one or other of the years 287,
290, 296, 308 (so Mason, <i>The Persec. of Diocl.</i>, pp. 275 seq.). Eusebius
gives a short account of the sect (<i>H. E.</i>, vii. 31). It was the <i>Acta
Archelai</i>, however, that became the principal source on the subject
of Manichaeism for Greek and Roman writers. These <i>Acta</i> are not
indeed what they give themselves out for, viz. an account of a disputation
held between Mani and the bishop Archelaus of Cascar,
in Mesopotamia; but they nevertheless contain much that is trustworthy,
especially regarding the doctrine of Mani, and they also
include Manichaean documents. They consist of various distinct pieces,
and originated in the beginning of the 4th century, probably
at Edessa. They were translated as early as the first half of the
same century from the Syriac (as is maintained by Jerome, <i>De vir.
illust.</i>, 72; though this is doubted by modern scholars) into Greek,
and soon afterwards into Latin. It is only this secondary Latin
version that we possess (ed. by C. H. Beeson; Leipzig, 1906, under
title <i>Hegemonius acta Archelai</i>); earlier editions, Zacagni (1698);
Routh, <i>Reliquiae sac.</i>, vol. v. (1848); translated in Clark&rsquo;s <i>Ante-Nicene
Library</i>, vol. xx.; small fragments of the Greek version
have been preserved. Regarding the <i>Acta Archelai</i>, see Zittwitz
in <i>Zeitschr. f. d. histor. Theol.</i> (1873) and Oblasinski, <i>Acta disp.
Arch. el Manetis</i> (1874). In the form in which we now possess
them, they are a compilation after the pattern of the <i>Clementine
Homilies</i>, and have been subjected to manifold redactions. These
<i>Acta</i> were used by Cyril of Jerusalem (<i>Catech.</i> 6), Epiphanius (<i>Haer.</i>
66), and a great number of other writers. All the Greek and Latin
heresiologists have included the Manichaeans in their catalogues;
but they seldom adduce any independent information regarding
them (see Theodoret, <i>Haer. fab.</i> i. 26). Important matter is to be
found in the resolutions of the councils from the 4th century onwards
(see Mansi, <i>Acta concil.</i>, and Hefele, <i>Conciliengeschichte</i>, vols. i.-iii.),
and also in the controversial writings of Titus of Bostra (6th century),
<span class="grk" title="Pros Manichaious">&#928;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#924;&#945;&#957;&#953;&#967;&#945;&#943;&#959;&#965;&#962;</span> (ed. Lagarde, 1859), and of Alexander of Lycopolis
<span class="grk" title="Logos pros tas Manichaiou doxas">&#923;&#972;&#947;&#959;&#962; &#960;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#964;&#8048;&#962; &#924;&#945;&#957;&#953;&#967;&#945;&#943;&#959;&#965; &#948;&#972;&#958;&#945;&#962;</span> (ed. Combefis; transl. in <i>Ante-Nic.
Lib.</i>, vol. xiv.). Of the Byzantines, the most worthy of mention
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page578" id="page578"></a>578</span>
are John of Damascus (<i>De haeres.</i> and <i>Dialog.</i>) and Photius (<i>cod.</i>
179 <i>Biblioth.</i>). The struggle with the Paulicians and the Bogomiles,
who were often simply identified with the Manichaeans, again
directed attention to the latter. In the West the works of Augustine
are the great repertory for information on the subject of Manichaeism
(<i>Contra epistolam Manichaei, quam vocant fundamenti</i>;
<i>Contra Faustum Manichaeum</i>; <i>Contra Fortunatum</i>; <i>Contra Adimantum</i>;
<i>Contra Secundinum</i>; <i>De actis cum Felice Manichaeo</i>; <i>De genesi
c. Manichaeos</i>; <i>De natura boni</i>; <i>De duabus animabus</i>; <i>De utilitate
credendi</i>; <i>De moribus eccl. cathol. et de moribus Manichaeorum</i>; <i>De
haeres.</i>). The more complete the picture, however, which may
here be obtained of Manichaeism, the more cautious must we be
in making generalizations from it, for it is beyond doubt that
Western Manichaeism adopted Christian elements which are wanting
in the original and in the Oriental Manichaeism. The &ldquo;Dispute
of Paul the Persian with a Manichaean&rdquo; in Migne <i>P.G.</i>, 88, col.
529-578 (first ed. by A. Mai) is shown by G. Mercati, <i>Studi e testi</i>
(Rome, 1901) to be the <i>procès verbal</i> of an actual discussion held
under Justinian at Constantinople in 527.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Literature.</span>&mdash;The most important works on Manichaeism are
Beausobre, <i>Hist. critique de Manichée et du Manichéisme</i> (2 vols.,
1734 seq.; the Christian elements in Manichaeism are here strongly,
indeed too strongly, emphasized); Baur, <i>Das manich. Religionssystem</i>
(1831; in this work Manichaean speculation is exhibited
from a speculative standpoint); Flügel, <i>Mani</i> (1862; a very careful
investigation on the basis of the <i>Fihrist</i>); Kessler, <i>Untersuchung zur

Kessler, <i>Mani</i> (2 vols., Berlin, 1889, 1903); Ernest Rochat, <i>Essai sur

of Mosheim, Lardner, Walch and Schröckh, as well as the monograph
by Trechsel, <i>Ueber Kanon, Kritik und Exegese der Manichäer</i> (1832),
may also be mentioned as still useful. The various researches which
have been made regarding Parsism, the ancient Semitic religions,
Gnosticism, &amp;c., are of the greatest importance for the investigation
of Manichaeism.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MANIKIALA,<a name="ar102" id="ar102"></a></span> a village of India, in Rawalpindi district of
the Punjab. Pop. (1901), 734. It contains one of the largest
<i>stupas</i> or Buddhist memorial shrines in N. India, and the one
first known to Europeans, who early detected traces of Greek
influence in the sculpture. The <i>stupa</i> was excavated by General
Court in 1834, and has been identified by Sir A. Cunningham
with the scene of Buddha&rsquo;s &ldquo;body-offering.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="bold">MANILA,<a name="ar103" id="ar103"></a></span> the capital city and principal port of the Philippine
Islands, situated on the W. coast of the island of Luzon,
on the E. shore of Manila Bay, at the mouth of the Pasig river,
in lat. 14° 35&prime; 31&Prime; N., and in long. 120° 58&prime; 8&Prime; E. It is about
4890 m. W.S.W. of Honolulu, 6990 m. W.S.W. of San Francisco,
628 m. S.E. of Hong-Kong, and 1630 m. S. by W. of Yokohama.
Pop. (1876), 93,595; (1887), 176,777; (1903), 219,928. Of
the total population in 1903, 185,351 were of the brown race,
21,838 were of the yellow race, 7943 were of the white race,
and 232 were of the black race (230 of those of this race were
foreign-born), and 4564 were of mixed races; of the same
total 131,659, or nearly 60% were males. The foreign-born
in 1903 numbered 29,491, comprising 21,083 natives of China,
4300 natives of the United States of America, 2065 natives
of Spain, and 721 natives of Japan. Nearly all of the brown
race were native-born, and 80.6% of them were Tagalogs.</p>

<p>The city covers an area of about 20 sq. m. of low ground,
through which flow the Pasig river and several <i>esteros</i>, or tidewater
creeks. To the west is the broad expanse of Manila Bay,
beyond which are the rugged Mariveles Mountains; to the
eastward the city extends about half-way to Laguna de Bay,
a lake nearly as large as Manila Bay and surrounded on three
sides by mountains. On the south bank of the Pasig and fronting
the bay for nearly a mile is the &ldquo;Ancient City,&rdquo; or Intramuros,
enclosed by walls 2½ m. long, with a maximum height of 25 ft.,
built about 1590. Formerly a moat flanked the city on the
land sides, and a drawbridge at each of six gates was raised
every night. But this practice was discontinued in 1852 and the
moat was filled with earth in 1905. In the north-west angle
of the walled enclosure stands Fort Santiago, which was built
at the same time as the walls to defend the entrance to the
river; the remaining space is occupied largely by a fine cathedral,
churches, convents, schools, and government buildings. Outside
the walls the modern city has been formed by the union
of several towns whose names are still retained as the names
of districts. The Pasig river is crossed by two modern steel
cantilever bridges. Near the north-east angle of Intramuros is
the Bridge of Spain, a stone structure across the Pasig, leading
to Binondo, the principal shopping and financial district;
here is the Escolta, the most busy thoroughfare of the city,
and the Rosario, noted for its Chinese shops. Between Binondo
and the bay is San Nicholas, with the United States custom-house
and large shipping interests. North of San Nicholas
is Tondo, the most densely populated district; in the suburbs,
outside the fire limits, the greater part of the inhabitants live
in native houses of bamboo frames roofed and sided with nipa
palm, and the thoroughfares consist of narrow streets and navigable
streams. Paco, south-west of Intramuros, has some large
cigar factories, and a large cemetery where the dead are buried in
niches in two concentric circular walls. Ermita and Malate along
the bay in the south part of the city, San Miguel on the north
bank of the river above Intramuros, and Sampaloc farther
north, are the more attractive residential districts.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Most of the white inhabitants live in Ermita and Malate, or in
San Miguel, where there are several handsome villas along the river
front, among them that of the governor-general of the Philippines.
The better sort of houses in Manila have two storeys, the lower one
built of brick or stone and the upper one of wood, roofed with red
Spanish tile or with corrugated iron; the upper storey contains the
living-rooms, and the lower has servants&rsquo; rooms, storehouses, stables,
carriage-houses and poultry yards. On account of the warm climate
the cornices are wide, the upper storey projects over the lower, and
the outer walls are fitted with sliding frames. Translucent oyster
shells are a common substitute for glass; and the walls are white-washed,
but on account of the frequency of earthquakes are not
plastered. More than one half of the dwellings in the city are mere
shacks or nipa huts. Few of the public buildings are attractive or
imposing. There are, however, some churches with graceful towers
and beautiful façades and a few attractive monuments; among the
latter are one standing on the Magellan Plaza (Plaza or Paseo de
Magellanes) beside the Pasig, to the memory of Ferdinand Magellan,
the discoverer of the islands; and another by A. Querol on the shore
of the bay, to the memory of Don Miguel de Legaspi (d. 1572), the
founder of the Spanish city, and of Andres de Urdaneta (1498-1568),
the Augustinian friar who accompanied Legaspi to Cebu (but not
to what is now Manila).</p>
</div>

<p>Many improvements have been made in and about the city
since the American occupation in 1898. The small tram-cars
drawn by native ponies have been replaced by a modern
American electric street-railway service, and the railway service
to and from other towns on the island of Luzon has been extended;
in 1908, 267 m. were open to traffic and 400 m. were
under construction. Connected with Manila by electric railway
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page579" id="page579"></a>579</span>
is Fort William McKinley, a U.S. army post in the hills five miles
away, quartering about 3000 men. The scheme for dredging
some of the <i>esteros</i> in order to make them more navigable and
for filling in others has been in part executed. But the greatest
improvement affecting transportation is the construction of
a safe and deep harbour. Although Manila Bay is nearly
landlocked, it is so large that in times of strong winds it becomes
nearly as turbulent as the open sea, and it was formerly so shallow
that vessels drawing more than 16 ft. could approach no nearer
than two miles to the shore, where typhoons of the south-west
monsoon not infrequently obliged them to lie several days
before they could be unloaded. Two long jetties or breakwaters
have now been constructed, about 350 acres of harbour
area have been dredged to a depth of 30 ft., and two wharves
of steel and concrete, one 600 ft. long and 70 ft. wide, and the
other 650 ft. long and 110 ft. wide, were in process of construction
in 1909. The Pasig river has been dredged up to the
Bridge of Spain to a depth of 18 ft. and from the Bridge of
Spain to Laguna de Bay to a depth of 6 ft. The construction
of the harbour was begun about 1880 by the Spanish government,
but the work was less than one-third completed when
the Americans took possession. Among other American
improvements were: an efficient fire department, a sewer
system whereby the sewage by means of pumps is discharged
into the bay more than a mile from the shore; a system of
gravity waterworks (1908) whereby the city&rsquo;s water supply
is taken from the Mariquina river about 23 m. from the city
into a storage reservoir which has a capacity of 2,000,000,000
gallons and is 212 ft. above the sea; the extension of the Luneta,
the principal pleasure-ground; a boulevard for several miles
along the bay; a botanical garden; and new market buildings.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Climate.</i>&mdash;Manila has a spring and summer hot season, an autumn
and winter cooler season, a summer and autumn rainy season, and a
winter and spring dry season. For the twenty years 1883-1902 the
annual average of mean monthly temperatures was 26.8° C., the
maximum being 27.4° in 1889 and 1897, and the minimum 26.2°
in 1884. From May until October the prevailing wind is south-east,
from November to January it is north, and from February to
April it is east. July and August are the cloudiest months of the
year; the average number of rainy days in each of those months
being 21, and in February or March only 3. The annual average
of rainy days is 138: 94 in the wet season (average precipitation for
the six months, 1556.3 mm.) and 44 in the dry season (average precipitation
for the six dry months, 382 mm.). Thunderstorms are
frequent and occasionally very severe, between May and September;
the annual average of thunderstorms for the decennium 1888-1897
was 505, the greatest frequency was in May (average 100.3) and in
June (average 90.7); the severity of these storms may be imagined
from the fact that in a half-hour between 5 and 6 <span class="scs">P.M.</span> on the 21st of
May 1892 the fall (probably the maximum) was 60 mm. The air
is very damp: for the period 1883-1902 the annual average of
humidity was 79.4%, the lowest average for any one month was
66.6% in April 1896 (the average for the twenty Aprils was 70.7),
and the highest average for any one month was 89.9% for September
1897 (the average for the twenty Septembers was 85.5). The city
is so situated as to be affected by shocks from all the various seismological
centres of Luzon, especially those from the active volcano
Taal, 35 m. south of the city. At the Manila observatory, about 1 m.
south-east of the walled city, the number of perceptible earthquakes
registered by seismograph between 1880 and 1897 inclusive was 221;
the greatest numbers for any one year were 26 in 1882 and 23 in
1892, and the least, 5 in 1896 and 6 in 1889 and in 1894; the average
number in each May was 1.44, in each July, 1.33, and in January
and in February 0.72; the frequency is much greater in each of the
spring summer months (except June, average 0.78) than in the
months of autumn and winter.</p>

<p><i>Public Institutions.</i>&mdash;The public school system of Manila includes,
besides the common schools and Manila high school, the American
school, the Philippine normal school (1901), the Philippine school
of arts and trades (1901), the Philippine medical school (1907) and
the Philippine school of commerce (1908). The Philippine government
also maintains here a bureau of science which publishes the
monthly <i>Philippine Journal of Science</i>, and co-operates with the
Jesuits in maintaining, in Ermita, the Manila observatory (meteorological,
seismological and astronomical), which is one of the best
equipped institutions of the kind in the East. The royal and
pontifical university of St Thomas Aquinas (generally known as the
university of Santo Tomas) was founded in 1857 with faculties of
theology, law, philosophy, science, medicine and pharmacy, and
grew out of a seminary, for the foundation of which Philip II. of
Spain gave a grant in 1585, and which opened in 1601; and of the
Dominican college of St Thomas, dating from 1611. Other educational
institutions are the (Dominican) San José medical and pharmaceutical
college, San Juan de Letrán (Dominican), which is a
primary and secondary school, the ateneo municipal, a corresponding
secondary and primary school under the charge of the Jesuits, and
the college of St Isabel, a girls&rsquo; school. In 1908 there were thirty-four
newspapers and periodicals published in the city, of which
thirteen were Spanish, fourteen were English, two were Chinese, and
five were Tagalog; the principal dailies were the <i>Manila Times</i>,
<i>Cablenews American</i>, <i>El Comercio</i>, <i>El Libertas</i>, <i>El Mercantil</i>, <i>El
Renacimiento</i> and <i>La Democracia</i>. There are several Spanish
hospitals in Manila, in two of which the city&rsquo;s indigent sick are cared
for at its expense; in connexion with another a reform school is
maintained; and there are a general hospital, built by the government,
a government hospital for contagious diseases, a government
hospital for government employees, a government hospital for lepers,
an army hospital, a free dispensary and hospital supported by
American philanthropists, St Paul&rsquo;s hospital (Roman Catholic),
University hospital (Protestant Episcopal), and the Mary Johnson
hospital (Methodist Episcopal). There are several American
Protestant churches in the city, notably a Protestant Episcopal
cathedral and training schools for native teachers. In Bibilid
prison, in the Santa Cruz district, nearly 80% of the prisoners of
the archipelago are confined; it is under the control of the department
of public instruction and its inmates are given an opportunity to
learn one or more useful trades.</p>

<p><i>Trade and Industry.</i>&mdash;Manila is important chiefly for its commerce,
and to make it the chief distributing point for American goods consigned
to Eastern markets the American government undertook the
harbour improvements, and abolished the tonnage dues levied under
Spanish rule. Manila is the greatest hemp market in the world;
110,399 tons, valued at $19,444,769, were exported from the archipelago
in 1906, almost all being shipped from Manila. Other
important exports are sugar, copra and tobacco. The imports
represent a great variety of food stuffs and manufactured articles.
In 1906 <span class="correction" title="duplicate the removed">the</span> total value of the exports was $23,902,986 and the
total value of the imports was $21,868,257. The coastwise
trade is large. The principal manufactures are tobacco, cigars,
cigarettes, malt liquors, distilled liquors, cotton fabrics, clothing,
ice, lumber, foundry and machine shop products, carriages, waggons,
furniture and boots and shoes. There is some ship and boat building.
Lumber is sawed by steam power, and cotton mills in the Tondo
district are operated by steam. In the foundries and machine shops
small engines, boilers and church bells are made, and the government
maintains an ice and cold-storage plant. With these exceptions
manufacturing is in a rather primitive state. Another industry of
importance, especially in the district of Tondo, is fishing, and the
city&rsquo;s markets are well supplied with many varieties of choice fish.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Administration.</i>&mdash;Manila is governed under a charter enacted
in 1901 by the Philippine commission, and amended in 1903.
This vests the legislative and administrative authority mainly
in a municipal board of five members, of whom three are appointed
by the governor of the Philippines by the advice and
with the consent of the Philippine commission, and the others
are the president of the advisory board and the city engineer.
The administration is divided into eight departments: engineering
and public works; sewer and waterworks construction;
sanitation and transportation; assessments and collections;
police, fire, law and schools. There are no elective offices, but
there is an advisory board, appointed by the governor and
consisting of one member from each of eleven districts; its recommendations
the municipal board must seek on all important
matters. The administration of justice is vested in a municipal
court and in one court under justices of the peace and auxiliary
justices; the administration of school affairs is vested in a special
board of six members; and matters pertaining to health are
administered by the insular bureau of health.</p>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;The Spanish city of Manila (named from &ldquo;nilad,&rdquo; a
weed or bush which grew in the locality) was founded by Legaspi
in 1571. The site had been previously occupied by a town under
a Mahommedan chieftain, but this town had been burned before
Legaspi gained possession, although a native settlement still
remained, within the present district of Tondo. In 1572, while
its fortifications were still slight, the Spanish city was attacked
and was nearly captured by a force of Chinese pirates who
greatly outnumbered the Spaniards. About 1590 the construction
of the present walls and other defences was begun.
At the beginning of the 17th century Manila had become the
commercial metropolis of the Far East. To it came fleets from
China, Japan, India, Malacca and other places in the Far East for
an exchange of wares, and from it rich cargoes were sent by way
of Mexico to the mother country in exchange for much cheaper
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page580" id="page580"></a>580</span>
goods. Before the close of the century, however, a decline began,
from which there was but little recovery under Spanish rule.
Several causes contributed to this, among them the waning of
the power of Spain, an exclusive commercial policy, dishonest
administration, hostilities with the Chinese, ravages of the Malay
pirates, and the growth of Dutch commerce. On several occasions
the city has been visited with destructive earthquakes;
those of 1645 and 1863 were especially disastrous. In 1762,
during war between England and Spain, an English force under
Vice-Admiral Sir Samuel Cornish (d. 1770) and Lieut.-General
Sir William Draper (1721-1787) breached the walls and captured
the city, but by the Treaty of Paris (1763) it was returned to
Spain. In 1837 the port of Manila was opened to foreign trade,
and there was a steady but slow increase in prosperity up to
about 1890. During this period, however, progress was hampered
by vested interests, and the spirit of rebellion among the natives
became increasingly threatening. About 1892 a large number
of Filipinos in and near Manila formed a secret association whose
object was independence and separation from Spain. In August
1896 members of this association began an attack; and late in
December the movement was reinforced as a result of the execution
in Manila of Dr José Rizal y Mercado (1861-1896), a Filipino
patriot. It spread to the provinces, and was only in part suppressed
when, in April 1898, the United States declared war
against Spain. On the 1st of May an American fleet under
Commodore George Dewey destroyed the Spanish fleet stationed
in Manila Bay (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Spanish-American War</a></span>). The smouldering
Filipino revolt then broke out afresh and an American army
under General Wesley Merritt (1836-&emsp;&emsp;) was sent from San
Francisco to assist in capturing the city. The Spaniards, after
making a rather weak defence, surrendered it on the 13th of
August 1898. Trouble now arose between the Americans and
the Filipinos under the leadership of Emilio Aguinaldo, for
the latter wished to establish a government of their own. On
the night of the 4th of February 1899 the Filipinos attacked the
American army which was defending the city, but were repulsed
after suffering a heavy loss. A military government, however,
was maintained in the city until August 1901.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MANILA HEMP,<a name="ar104" id="ar104"></a></span> the most valuable of all fibres for cordage,
the produce of the leaf-stalks of <i>Musa textilis</i>, a native of the
Philippine Islands. The plant, called <i>abacá</i> by the islanders,
throws up a spurious stem from its underground rootstocks,
consisting of a cluster of sheathing leaf-stalks, which rise to a
height of from 15 to 25 ft. and spread out into a crown of huge
undivided leaves characteristic of the various species of <i>Musa</i>
(plantain, banana, &amp;c.). From 12 to 20 clusters are developed
on each rhizome. In its native regions the plant is rudely cultivated
solely as a source of fibre; it requires little attention, and
when about three years old develops flowers on a central stem,
at which stage it is in the most favourable condition for yielding
fibre. The stock is then cut down, and the sheathing stalks are
torn asunder and reduced to small strips. These strips in their
fresh succulent condition are drawn between a knife-edged instrument
and a hard wooden block to which it is fixed. The knife is
kept in contact with the block except when lifted to introduce the
ribbons. Sufficient weight is suspended to the end of the knife
to keep back all pith when the operator is drawing forward the
ribbon between the block and knife. By repeated scraping in
this way the soft cellular matter which surrounds the fibre is
removed, and the fibre so cleaned has only to be hung up to dry
in the open air, when, without further treatment, it is ready for
use. Each stock yields, on an average, a little under 1 &#8468; of
fibre; and two natives cutting down plants and separating fibre
will prepare not more than 25 &#8468; per day. The fibre yielded by
the outer layer of leaf-stalks is hard, fully developed and strong,
and used for cordage, but the produce of the inner stalks is
increasingly thin, fine and weak. The finer fibre is used by the
natives, without spinning or twisting (the ends of the single fibres
being knotted or gummed together), for making exceedingly
fine, light and transparent yet comparatively strong textures,
which they use as articles of dress and ornament. According
to Warden, &ldquo;muslin and grass-cloth are made from the finest
fibres of Manila hemp, and some of them are so fine that a garment
made of them may, it is said, be enclosed in the hollow of
the hand.&rdquo; In Europe, especially in France, articles of clothing,
such as shirts, veils, neckerchiefs and women&rsquo;s hats, are made
from <i>abacá</i>. It is also used for matting and twines. It is of a
light colour, very lustrous, and possesses great strength, being
thus exceptionally suitable for the best class of ropes. It is
extensively used for marine and other cordage. The hemp
exported for cordage purposes is a somewhat woody fibre, of a
bright brownish-white colour, and possessing great durability
and strain-resisting power. The strength of Manila hemp
compared with English hemp is indicated by the fact that a
Manila rope 3¼ in. in circumference and 2 fathoms long stood
a strain of 4669 &#8468; before giving way, while a similar rope of
English hemp broke with 3885 &#8468;. The fibre contains a very
considerable amount of adherent pectinous matter, and in its
so-called dry condition an unusually large proportion, as much
as 12% of water. In a damp atmosphere the fibre absorbs
moisture so freely that it has been found to contain not less than
40% of water, a circumstance which dealers in the raw fibre
should bear in mind. From the old and disintegrated ropes
is made the well-known manila paper. The plant has been
introduced into tropical lands&mdash;the West Indies, India, Borneo,
&amp;c.&mdash;but only in the Philippines has the fibre been successfully
produced as an article of commerce. It is distributed throughout
the greater part of the Philippine Archipelago. The area of
successful cultivation lies approximately between 6° and 15° N.
and 121° and 126° E.; it may be successfully cultivated up to
about 4000 ft. above sea-level. The provinces, or islands, where
cultivation is most successful are those with a heavy and evenly
distributed rainfall. H. T. Edwards, fibre expert to the Philippine
bureau of agriculture, wrote in 1904:&mdash;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>&ldquo;The opportunities for increasing the production of <i>abacá</i> in the
Philippines are almost unlimited. Enormous areas of good <i>abacá</i>
land are as yet untouched, while the greater part of land already
under cultivation might yield a greatly increased product if more
careful attention were given to the various details of cultivation.
The introduction of irrigation will make possible the planting of
<i>abacá</i> in many districts where it is now unknown. The <i>perfection</i>
of a machine for the extraction of the fibre will increase the entire
output by nearly one-third, as this amount is now lost by the wasteful
hand-stripping process.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Hitherto, while numerous attempts have been made to extract
the fibre with machinery, some obstacle has always prevented
the general use of the process. The exports have increased
with great rapidity, as shown by the following table:&mdash;</p>

<table class="ws f90" summary="Contents">
<tr><td class="tcc">1870</td> <td class="tcr">31,426</td> <td class="tcc">tons.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tcc">1880</td> <td class="tcr">50,482</td> <td class="tcc">&rdquo;</td></tr>

<tr><td class="tcc">1904</td> <td class="tcr">121,637</td> <td class="tcc">&rdquo;</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="noind">In 1901 the value of the export was $14,453,410, or 62.3% of the
total exports from the Philippines. The fibre is now so valuable
that Manila hemp cordage is freely adulterated by manufacturers,
chiefly by admixture of phormium (New Zealand flax) and
Russian hemp.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MANILIUS,<a name="ar105" id="ar105"></a></span> a Roman poet, author of a poem in five books
called <i>Astronomica</i>. The author is neither quoted nor mentioned
by any ancient writer. Even his name is uncertain, but it was
probably Marcus Manilius; in the earlier MSS. the author is
anonymous, the later give Manilius, Manlius, Mallius. The poem
itself implies that the writer lived under Augustus or Tiberius,
and that he was a citizen of and resident in Rome. According
to R. Bentley he was an Asiatic Greek; according to F. Jacob
an African. His work is one of great learning; he had studied
his subject in the best writers, and generally represents the most
advanced views of the ancients on astronomy (or rather astrology).
He frequently imitates Lucretius, whom he resembles in earnestness
and originality and in the power of enlivening the dry bones
of his subject. Although his diction presents some peculiarities,
the style is metrically correct. Firmicus, who wrote in the time
of Constantine, exhibits so many points of resemblance with the
work of Manilius that he must either have used him or have
followed some work that Manilius also followed. As Firmicus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page581" id="page581"></a>581</span>
says that hardly any Roman except Caesar, Cicero and Fronto
had treated the subject, it is probable that he did not know the
work of Manilius. The latest event referred to in the poem
(i. 898) is the great defeat of Varus by Arminius in the Teutoburgiensis
Saltus (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 9). The fifth book was not written till
the reign of Tiberius; the work appears to be incomplete, and
was probably never published.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MANILIUS, GAIUS,<a name="ar106" id="ar106"></a></span> Roman tribune of the people in 66 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>
At the beginning of his year of office (Dec. 67) he succeeded in
getting a law passed (<i>de libertinorum suffragiis</i>), which gave
freedmen the privilege of voting together with those who had
manumitted them, that is, in the same tribe as their patroni; this
law, however, was almost immediately declared null and void
by the senate. Both parties in the state were offended by the
law, and Manilius endeavoured to secure the support of Pompey
by proposing to confer upon him the command of the war
against Mithradates with unlimited power (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Pompey</a></span>). The
proposal was supported by Cicero in his speech, <i>Pro lege Manilia</i>,
and carried almost unanimously. Manilius was later accused
by the aristocratical party on some unknown charge and defended
by Cicero. He was probably convicted, but nothing further
is heard of him.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MANIN, DANIELE<a name="ar107" id="ar107"></a></span> (1804-1857), Venetian patriot and statesman,
was born in Venice, on the 13th of May 1804. He was the
son of a converted Jew, who took the name of Manin because that
patrician family stood sponsors to him, as the custom then was.
He studied law at Padua, and then practised at the bar of his
native city. A man of great learning and a profound jurist, he was
inspired from an early age with a deep hatred for Austria. The
heroic but foolhardy attempt of the brothers Bandiera, Venetians
who had served in the Austrian navy against the Neapolitan
Bourbons in 1844, was the first event to cause an awakening of
Venetian patriotism, and in 1847 Manin presented a petition
to the Venetian congregation, a shadowy consultative assembly
tolerated by Austria but without any power, informing the
emperor of the wants of the nation. He was arrested on a
charge of high treason (Jan. 18, 1848), but this only served to
increase the agitation of the Venetians, who were beginning to
know and love Manin. Two months later, when all Italy and
half the rest of Europe were in the throes of revolution, the
people forced Count Palffy, the Austrian governor, to release him
(March 17). The Austrians soon lost all control of the city, the
arsenal was seized by the revolutionists, and under the direction
of Manin a civic guard and a provisional government were
instituted. The Austrians evacuated Venice on the 26th of
March, and Manin became president of the Venetian republic.
He was already in favour of Italian unity, and though not
anxious for annexation to Piedmont (he would have preferred
to invoke French aid), he gave way to the will of the majority,
and resigned his powers to the Piedmontese commissioners on the
7th of August. But after the Piedmontese defeats in Lombardy,
and the armistice by which King Charles Albert abandoned
Lombardy and Venetia to Austria, the Venetians attempted to
lynch the royal commissioners, whose lives Manin saved with
difficulty; an assembly was summoned, and a triumvirate
formed with Manin at its head. Towards the end of 1848 the
Austrians, having been heavily reinforced, reoccupied all the
Venetian mainland; but the citizens, hard-pressed and threatened
with a siege, showed the greatest devotion to the cause of freedom,
all sharing in the dangers and hardships and all giving what they
could afford to the state treasury. Early in 1849 Manin was
again chosen president of the republic, and conducted the defence
of the city with great ability. After the defeat of Charles
Albert&rsquo;s forlorn hope at Novara in March the Venetian assembly
voted &ldquo;Resistance at all costs!&rdquo; and granted Manin unlimited
powers. Meanwhile the Austrian forces closed round the city;
but Manin showed an astonishing power of organization, in
which he was ably seconded by the Neapolitan general, Guglielmo
Pepe. But on the 26th of May the Venetians were forced to
abandon Fort Malghera, half-way between the city and the
mainland; food was becoming scarce, on the 19th of June the
powder magazine blew up, and in July cholera broke out. Then
the Austrian batteries began to bombard Venice itself, and when
the Sardinian fleet withdrew from the Adriatic the city was also
attacked by sea, while certain demagogues caused internal
trouble. At last, on the 24th of August 1849, when all provisions
and ammunition were exhausted, Manin, who had courted
death in vain, succeeded in negotiating an honourable capitulation,
on terms of amnesty to all save Manin himself, Pepe and
some others, who were to go into exile. On the 27th Manin left
Venice for ever on board a French ship. His wife died at
Marseilles, and he himself reached Paris broken in health and
almost destitute, having spent all his fortune for Venice. In
Paris he maintained himself by teaching and became a leader
among the Italian exiles. There he became a convert from
republicanism to monarchism, being convinced that only under
the auspices of King Victor Emmanuel could Italy be freed, and
together with Giorgio Pallavicini and Giuseppe La Farina he
founded the <i>Società Nazionale Italiana</i> with the object of propagating
the idea of unity under the Piedmontese monarchy.
His last years were embittered by the terrible sufferings of his
daughter, who died in 1854, and he himself died on the 22nd of
September 1857, and was buried in Ary Scheffer&rsquo;s family tomb.
In 1868, two years after the Austrians finally departed from
Venice, his remains were brought to his native city and honoured
with a public funeral. Manin was a man of the greatest honesty,
and possessed genuinely statesmanlike qualities. He believed
in Italian unity when most men, even Cavour, regarded it as
a vain thing, and his work of propaganda by means of the
National Society greatly contributed to the success of the cause.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MANING, FREDERICK EDWARD<a name="ar108" id="ar108"></a></span> (1812-1883), New Zealand
judge and author, son of Frederick Maning, of Johnville, county
Dublin, was born on the 5th of July 1812. His father emigrated
to Tasmania in the ship &ldquo;Ardent&rdquo; in 1824 and took up a grant
of land there. Young Maning served in the fatuous expedition
which attempted to drive in the Tasmanian blacks by sweeping
with an unbroken line of armed men across the island. Soon
afterwards he decided to try the life of a trader among the wild
tribes of New Zealand, and, landing in the beautiful inlet of
Hokianga in 1833, took up his abode among the Ngapuhi. With
them the tall Irish lad&mdash;he stood 6 ft. 3 in.&mdash;full of daring and
good-humour and as fond of fun as of fighting, quickly became
a prime favourite, was adopted into the tribe, married a chief&rsquo;s
daughter, and became a &ldquo;Pakeha-Maori&rdquo; (foreigner turned
Maori). With the profits of his trading he bought a farm of
200 acres on the Hokianga, for which, unlike most white adventurers
of the time, he paid full value. When New Zealand was
peacefully annexed in 1840, Maning&rsquo;s advice to the Maori was
against the arrangement, but from the moment of annexation
he became a loyal friend to the government, and in the wars of
1845-46 his influence was exerted with effect in the settlers&rsquo;
favour. Again, in 1860, he persuaded the Ngapuhi to volunteer
to put down the insurrection in Taranaki. Finally, at the end
of 1865, he entered the public service as a judge of the native
lands court, where his unequalled knowledge of the Maori
language, customs, traditions and prejudices was of solid value.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page582" id="page582"></a>582</span>
In this office he served until 1881, when ill-health drove him to
resign, and two years later to seek surgical aid in London,
where, however, he died of cancer on the 25th of July 1883. At
his wish, his body was taken back to New Zealand and buried
there. A bust of him is placed in the public library at Auckland.
Maning is chiefly remembered as the author of two short books,
<i>Old New Zealand and History of the War in the North of New
Zealand against the Chief Heké</i>. Both books were reprinted in
London in 1876 and 1884, with an introduction by the earl of
Pembroke.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MANIPLE<a name="ar109" id="ar109"></a></span> (Lat. <i>manipulus</i>, from <i>manus</i>, hand, and <i>plere</i>, to
fill), a liturgical vestment of the Catholic Church, proper to all
orders from the subdeacon upwards. It is a narrow strip of
material, silk or half-silk, about a yard long, worn on the left
fore-arm in such a way that the ends hang down to an equal
length on either side. In order to secure it, it is sometimes tied
on with strings attached underneath, sometimes provided with
a hole in the lining through which the arm is passed. It is
ornamented with three crosses, one in the centre and one at each
end, that in the centre being obligatory, and is often elaborately
embroidered. It is the special ensign of the office of subdeacon,
and at the ordination is placed on the arm of the new subdeacon
by the bishop with the words: &ldquo;Take the maniple, the symbol
of the fruit of good works.&rdquo;<a name="fa1n" id="fa1n" href="#ft1n"><span class="sp">1</span></a> It is strictly a &ldquo;mass vestment,&rdquo;
being worn, with certain exceptions (<i>e.g.</i> by a subdeacon singing
the Gospel at the service of blessing the palms), only at Mass,
by the celebrant and the ministers assisting.</p>

<p>The most common name for the maniple up to the beginning
of the 11th century in the Latin Church was <i>mappula</i> (dim. of
<i>mappa</i>, cloth), the Roman name for the vestment until the
time of Innocent III. The designation <i>manipulus</i> did not come
into general use until the 15th century. Father Braun (<i>Liturg.
Gewandung</i>, p. 517) gives other early medieval names: <i>sudanum</i>,
<i>fano</i>, <i>mantile</i>, all of them meaning &ldquo;cloth&rdquo; or &ldquo;handkerchief.&rdquo;
He traces the vestment ultimately to a white linen cloth of
ceremony (<i>pallium linostinum</i>) worn in the 4th century by the
Roman clergy over the left arm, and peculiar at that time to
them. Its ultimate origin is obscure, but is probably traceable
to some ceremonial handkerchiefs commonly carried by Roman
dignitaries, <i>e.g.</i> those with which the magistrates were wont
to signal the opening of the games of the circus. As late as the
9th century, indeed, the maniple was still a handkerchief, held
folded in the left hand. By what process it became changed
into a narrow strip is not known; the earliest extant specimen of
the band-like maniple is that found in the grave of St Cuthbert
(9th century); by the 11th century (except in the case of
subdeacons, whose maniples would seem to have continued
for a while to be cloths in practical use) the maniple had universally
assumed its present general form and purely ceremonial
character.</p>

<p>The maniple was originally carried in the left hand. In pictures
of the 9th, 10th and 11th centuries it is represented as either so
carried or as hung over the left fore-arm. By the 12th century
the rule according to which it is worn over the left arm had been
universally accepted. According to present usage the maniple
is put on by priests after the alb and girdle; by deacons and
subdeacons after the dalmatic or tunicle; by bishops at the altar
after the <i>Confiteor</i>, except at masses for the dead, when it is
assumed before the stole.<a name="fa2n" id="fa2n" href="#ft2n"><span class="sp">2</span></a></p>

<p>In the East the maniple in its Western form is known only to
the Armenians, where it is peculiar to subdeacons. This vestment
is not derived from the Roman rite, but is properly a stole,
which the subdeacons used to carry in the left hand. It is now
laid over the subdeacon&rsquo;s left arm at ordination. The true
equivalent of the maniple (in the Greek and Armenian rites only)
is not, as has been assumed, the <i>epimanikion</i>, a sort of loose,
embroidered cuff (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Vestments</a></span>), but the <i>epigonation</i>. This
is a square of silk, stiffened with cardboard, surrounded by an
embroidered border, and usually decorated in the middle with
a cross or a sword (the &ldquo;sword of the Spirit,&rdquo; which it is supposed
to symbolize); sometimes, however, the space within the border
is embroidered with pictures. It is worn only by bishops and
the higher clergy, and derives its name from the fact that it hangs
down over the knee (<span class="grk" title="gony">&#947;&#972;&#957;&#965;</span>). It is worn on the right side, under the
<i>phelonion</i>, but when the <i>sakkos</i> is worn instead of the <i>phelonion</i>,
by metropolitans, &amp;c., it is attached to this. The <i>epigonation</i>,
like the maniple, was originally a cloth held in the hand; a fact
sufficiently proved by the ancient name <span class="grk" title="egcheirion">&#7952;&#947;&#967;&#949;&#943;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#957;</span> (<span class="grk" title="cheir">&#967;&#949;&#943;&#961;</span>, hand),
which it retained until the 12th century. For convenience&rsquo; sake
this cloth came to be suspended from the girdle on the right side,
and is thus represented in the earliest extant paintings (see
Braun, p. 552). The name <i>epigonation</i>, which appears in the
latter half of the 12th century, probably marks the date of the
complete conventionalizing of the original cloth into the present
stiff embroidered square; but the earliest representations of the
vestment in its actual form date from the 14th century, <i>e.g.</i> the
mosaic of St Athanasius in the chapel of St Zeno in St Mark&rsquo;s
at Venice.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MANIPUR,<a name="ar110" id="ar110"></a></span> a native state on the north-east frontier of India,
in political subordination to the lieutenant-governor of Eastern
Bengal and Assam. Area, 8456 sq. m. Pop. (1901), 284,465.
It is bounded on the N. by the Naga country and the hills overlooking
the Assam valley, on the W. by Cachar district, on the E.
by Upper Burma, and on the S. by the Lushai hills. The state
consists of a wide valley, estimated at about 650 sq. m., and a
large surrounding tract of mountainous country. The hill
ranges generally run north and south, with occasional connecting
spurs and ridges of lower elevation between. Their greatest
altitude is in the north, where they reach to upwards of 8000 ft.
above sea-level. The principal geographical feature in the valley
is the Logtak lake, an irregular sheet of water of considerable
size, but said to be yearly growing smaller. The valley is watered
by numerous rivers, the Barak being the most important. The
hills are densely clothed with tree jungle and large forest timber.
Some silk is produced and there are a few primitive manufacturing
industries, <i>e.g.</i> of pottery. Rice and forest produce, however,
are the principal exports. The road from Manipur to the Assam-Bengal
railway at Dimapur is the principal trade route.</p>

<p>The kingdom of Manipur, or, as the Burmans call it, Kasse
or Kathe, first emerges from obscurity as a neighbour and ally
of the Shan kingdom of Pong, which had its capital at Mogaung.
The valley appears to have been originally occupied by several
tribes which came from different directions. Although their
general facial characteristics are Mongolian, there is a great
diversity of feature among the Manipuris, some of them showing
a regularity approaching the Aryan type. In the valley the
people are chiefly Hindus, that religion being of recent introduction.
Their own name for themselves is Meithei, and their
language is a branch of the Kuki-Chin family, spoken by 273,000
persons in all India in 1901. One of their peculiarities is the high
position enjoyed by women, who conduct most of the trade of
the valley. They have a caste system of their own, different
from that of India, and chiefly founded on the system of <i>lallup</i>,
or forced labour, which has been abolished by the British. Every
male between the ages of seventeen and sixty was formerly
obliged to place his services at the disposal of the state for
a certain number of days each year, and to different classes of
the people different employments were assigned. About four
hundred Mahommedan families, descendants of settlers from
Bengal, reside to the east of the capital. The aboriginal hill-men
belong to one of the two great divisions of Nagas and Kukis,
and are subdivided into innumerable clans and sections with
slight differences in language, customs or dress. The state is
noted for the excellence of its breed of ponies. The English game
of polo was introduced from Manipur, where it forms a great
national pastime.</p>

<p>The first relations of the British with Manipur date from 1762,
when the raja solicited British aid to repel a Burmese invasion,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page583" id="page583"></a>583</span>
and a treaty was entered into. The force was recalled, and little
communication between the two countries took place until 1824,
on the outbreak of the first Burmese War. British assistance
was again invoked by the raja, and the Burmese were finally
expelled from both the Assam and the Manipur valleys. Disputed
successions have always been a cause of trouble. The raja,
Chandra Kirtti Singh, died in 1886, and was succeeded by his
eldest son, Sur Chandra Singh, who appointed his next brother,
Kula Chandra Dhuya Singh, <i>jubraj</i>, or heir-apparent. In 1890
another brother, the <i>senapati</i>, or commander-in-chief, Tikendrajit
Singh, dethroned the raja, and installed the <i>jubraj</i> as regent,
the ex-raja retiring to Calcutta. In March 1891 the chief commissioner
of Assam (Quinton) marched to Manipur with 400 Gurkhas,
in order to settle the question of succession. His purpose was to
recognize the new ruler, but to remove the <i>senapati</i>. After some
futile negotiations, Quinton sent an ultimatum, requiring the
surrender of the <i>senapati</i>, by the hands of the political resident,
F. Grimwood, but no result followed. An attempt was then made
to arrest the <i>senapati</i>, but after some sharp fighting, in which
Lieut. Brackenbury was killed, he escaped; and the Manipuris
then attacked the British residency with an overwhelming force.
Quinton was compelled to ask for a parley, and he, Colonel Skene,
Grimwood, Cossins and Lieut. Simpson, unarmed, went to the
fort to negotiate. They were all there treacherously murdered,
and when the news arrived the Gurkhas retreated to Cachar,
Mrs Grimwood and the wounded being with them. This led to
a military expedition, which did not encounter much resistance.
The various columns, converging on Manipur, found it deserted;
and the regent, <i>senapati</i>, and others were captured during May.
After a formal trial the <i>senapati</i> and one of the generals of the
rebellion were hanged and the regent was transported to the
Andaman Islands. But it was decided to preserve the existence
of the state, and a child of the ruling family, named Chura Chand,
of the age of five, was nominated raja. He was sent to be
educated in the Mayo College at Ajmere, and he afterwards served
for two years in the imperial cadet corps. Meanwhile the administration
was conducted under British supervision. The opportunity
was seized for abolishing slavery and unpaid forced labour,
a land revenue of Rs. 2 per acre being substituted in the valley
and a house-tax in the hills. The boundaries of the state were
demarcated, disarmament was carried out, and the construction
of roads was pushed forward. In 1901 Manipur was visited by
Lord Curzon, on his way from Cachar to Burma. In May 1907
the government of the state was handed over to Chura Chand,
who was to be assisted by a council of six Manipuris, with a
member of the Indian civil service as vice-president. At the
same time it was announced that the government of India would
support the raja with all its powers and suppress summarily
all attempts to displace him. The revenue is £26,000. The
capital is Imphal, which is really an overgrown village; pop.
(1901), 67,093.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MANISA<a name="ar111" id="ar111"></a></span> (anc. <i>Magnesia ad Sipylum</i>), the chief town of the
Saru-khan sanjak of the Aidin (Smyrna) vilayet of Asia Minor,
situated in the valley of the Gediz Chai (Hermus), at the foot of
Mt Sipylus, and connected by railway with Smyrna and Afium
Kara-Hissar. Pop. about 35,000, half being Mussulman.
Manisa is an important commercial centre, and contains interesting
buildings dating from the times of the Seljuk and early
Osmanli sultans, including mosques built by Murad II. and III.
and a Mevlevi <i>Tekke</i> second only to that at Konia. It is the
seat of a flourishing American mission. In 1204 Manisa was
occupied by John Ducas, who when he became emperor made
it the Byzantine seat of government. In 1305, after the inhabitants
had massacred the Catalan garrison, Roger de Flor
besieged it unsuccessfully. In 1313 the town was taken by Saru
Khan and became the capital of the Turcoman emirate of that
name. In 1398 it submitted to the Osmanli sultan Bayezid I.,
and in 1402 was made a treasure city by Timur. In 1419 it was
the scene of the insurrection of the liberal reformer, Bedr ed-Din,
which was crushed by Prince Murad, whose residence in the town
as Murad II., after twice abdicating the throne, is one of the most
romantic stories in Turkish history. In the 17th century Manisa
became the residence of the greatest of the Dere Bey families,
Kara Osman Oglu, Turcoman by origin, and possibly connected
with the former emirs of Sarukhan, which seems to have risen
to power by farming the taxes of a province which princes of the
house of Othman had often governed and regarded with especial
affection. The <i>liva</i> of Sarukhan was one of the twenty-two in
the Ottoman Empire leased on a life tenure up to the time of
Mahmud II. In the 18th century the family of Kara Osman
Oglu (or Karasman) ruled <i>de facto</i> all west central Anatolia, one
member being lord of Bergama and another of Aidin, while the
head of the house held Manisa with all the Hermus valley and
had greater power in Smyrna than the representative of the
capitan pasha in whose province that city nominally lay. Outside
their own fiefs the family had so much property that it was
commonly said they could sleep in a house of their own at any
stage from Smyrna to Baghdad. The last of its great beys was
Haji Hussein Zad&#275;, who was frequently called in to Smyrna on
the petition of his friends, the European merchants, to assure
tranquillity in the troublous times consequent on Napoleon&rsquo;s
invasion of Egypt, and the British and Russian attacks on the
Porte early in the 19th century. He always acquitted himself
well, but having refused to bring his contingent to the grand
vizier when on the march to Egypt in 1798, and awakened the
jealousy of the capitan pasha, he was in continual danger.
Exiled in 1812, he was subsequently restored to Manisa, and died
there in 1821. His son succeeded after sanguinary tumults;
but Mahmud II., who had long marked the family for destruction,
was so hostile towards it, after he had got rid of the
janissaries, that it had lost all but the shadow of power by 1830.
Descendants survived in Manisa who retained a special right of
granting title-deeds within the district, independent of the local
administration.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MANITOBA,<a name="ar114" id="ar114"></a></span> one of the western provinces of the Dominion
of Canada, situated midway between the Atlantic and the Pacific
coasts of the Dominion, about 1090 m. due west of Quebec.
It is bounded S. by the parallel 49° N., which divides
it from the United States; W. by 101° 20&prime; W.; N. by 52°
50&prime; N.; and E. by the western boundary of Ontario.
Manitoba formerly belonged to the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company,
and after the transfer of its territory to Canada was admitted
in 1870 as the fifth province of the Dominion. At that time
the infant province had an area of 13,500 sq. m., and some
12,000 people, chiefly Indian half-breeds. In 1881 the limits
were increased as above, and the province now contains upwards
of 73,956 sq. m., extending 264 m. from north to south and
upwards of 300 from east to west. The old district of Assiniboia,
the result of the efforts in colonization by the earl of Selkirk
in 1811 and succeeding years, was the nucleus of the province.</p>

<p>The name Manitoba sprang from the union of two Indian
words, <i>Manito</i> (the Great Spirit), and <i>Waba</i> (the &ldquo;narrows&rdquo;
of the lake, which may readily be seen on the map). This well-known
strait was a sacred place to the Crees and Saulteaux,
who, impressed by the weird sound made by the wind as it
rushed through the narrows, as simple children of the prairies
called them <i>Manito-Waba</i>, or the &ldquo;Great Spirit&rsquo;s narrows.&rdquo;
The name, arising from this unusual sound, has been by metonymy
translated into &ldquo;God&rsquo;s Voice.&rdquo; The word was afterwards
contracted into its present form. As there is no accent in
Indian words, the natural pronunciation of this name would
be M&#257;n-&#299;-t&#333;-b&#257;. On this account, the custom of both the French
and English people of the country was for years before and for
several years after 1870 to pronounce it M&#257;n-&#301;-t&#335;-b&#257;, and even
in some cases to spell it &ldquo;Manitobah.&rdquo; After the formation
of the province and the familiar use of the provincial name
in the Dominion parliament, where it has occupied much
attention for a generation, the pronunciation has changed,
so that the province is universally known from ocean to ocean
as M&#257;n-&#301;-t&#333;-b&#259;.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Physical Features.</i>&mdash;The drainage of Manitoba is entirely north-eastward
to Hudson Bay. The three lakes&mdash;whose greatest lengths
are 260,122 and 119 m. respectively&mdash;are Winnipeg, Winnipegosis and
Manitoba. They are all of irregular shape, but average respectively
30, 18 and 10 m. in width. They are fresh, shallow and tideless.
Winnipegosis and Manitoba at high water, in spring-time, discharge
their overflow through small streams into Winnipeg. The chief
rivers emptying into Lake Winnipeg are the Winnipeg, the Red and
the Saskatchewan. The Assiniboine river enters the Red river 45 m.
from Lake Winnipeg, and at the confluence of the rivers (&ldquo;The
Forks&rdquo;) is situated the city of Winnipeg. The Winnipeg, which
flows from the territory lying south-east of Lake Winnipeg, is a noble
river some 200 m. long, which after leaving Lake of the Woods dashes
with its clear water over many cascades, and traverses very beautiful
scenery. At its falls from Lake of the Woods is one of the greatest
and most easily utilized water-powers in the world, and from falls
lower down the river electric power for the city of Winnipeg is
obtained. The Red river is at intervals subject to freshets. In a
century&rsquo;s experience of the Selkirk colonists there have been four
&ldquo;floods.&rdquo; The highest level of the site of the city of Winnipeg is
said to have been under 5 ft. of water for several weeks in May and
June in 1826, and 2½ ft. in 1852, not covered in 1861; only the lowest
levels were under water in 1882. The extent of overflow has thus
on each occasion been less. The loose soil on the banks of the river
is every year carried away in great masses, and the channel has so
widened as to render the recurrence of an overflow unlikely. The
Saskatchewan, though not in the province, empties into Lake
Winnipeg less than half a degree from the northern boundary. It
is a mighty river, rising in the Rocky Mountains, and crossing
eighteen degrees of longitude. Near its mouth are the Grand Rapids.
Above these steamers ply to Fort Edmonton, a point upwards of
800 m. north-west of the city of Winnipeg. Steamers run from
Grand Rapids, through Lake Winnipeg, up Red river to the city
of Winnipeg, important locks having been constructed on the river
at St Andrews.</p>

<p>The surface of Manitoba is somewhat level and monotonous. It
is chiefly a prairie region, with treeless plains of from 5 to 40 m.
extent, covered in summer with an exuberant vegetable growth,
which dies every year. The river banks, however, are fringed with
trees, and in the more undulating lands the timber belts vary from
a few hundreds of yards to 5 or 10 m. in width, forming at times
forests of no inconsiderable size. The chief trees of the country
are the aspen (<i>Populus tremuloides</i>), the ash-leaved maple (<i>Negundo
aceroides</i>), oak (<i>Quercus alba</i>), elm (<i>Ulmus Americana</i>), and many
varieties of willow. The strawberry, raspberry, currant, plum,
cherry and grape are indigenous.</p>

<div class="center ptb2"><img style="width:521px; height:607px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img584.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p><i>Climate.</i>&mdash;The climate of Manitoba, being that of a region of wide
extent and of similar conditions, is not subject to frequent variations.
Winter, with cold but clear and bracing weather, usually sets in
about the middle of November, and ends with March. In April
and May the rivers have opened, the snow has disappeared, and the
opportunity has been afforded the farmer of sowing his grain. June
is often wet, but most favourable for the springing crops; July and
August are warm, but, excepting two or three days at a time, not
uncomfortably so; while the autumn weeks of late August and
September are very pleasant. Harvest generally extends from the
middle of August to near the end of September. The chief crops
of the farmer are wheat (which from its flinty hardness and full kernel
is the specialty of the Canadian north-west), oats, barley and pease.
Hay is made of the native prairie grasses, which grow luxuriantly.
From the richness and mellowness of the soil potatoes and all taproots
reach a great size. Heavy dews in summer give the needed
moisture after the rains of June have ceased. The traveller and
farmer are at times annoyed by the mosquito.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Area and Population.</i>&mdash;The area is 73,956 sq. m., of which
64,066 are land and 9890 water. Pop. (1871), 18,995; (1881),
62,260; (1891), 152,506; (1901), 254,947 (138,332 males, 116,615
females); (1906), 365,688 (205,183 males and 160,505 females).
The principal cities and towns are: Winnipeg (90,153), Brandon
(10,408), Portage la Prairie (5106), St Boniface (5119), West
Selkirk (2701), and Morden (1437). In 1901, 49,102 families
inhabited 48,415 houses, and the proportion of the urban population
to the rural was 27.5 to 72.5. Classified according to place
of birth, the principal nationalities were as follows in 1901:
Canada, 180,853; England, 20,392; Scotland, 8099; Ireland,
4537; other British possessions, 490; Germany, 2291; Iceland,
5403; Austria, 11,570; Russia and Poland, 8854; Scandinavia,
1772; United States, 6922; other countries, 4028. In 1901
the Indians numbered 5827; half-breeds, 10,372. Of the
Indian half-breeds, one half are of English-speaking parentage,
and chiefly of Orkney origin; the remainder are known as
Metis or Bois-brûlés, and are descended from French-Canadian
voyageurs. In 1875 a number of Russian Mennonites (descendants
of the Anabaptists of the Reformation) came to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page585" id="page585"></a>585</span>
country. They originally emigrated from Germany to the
plains of southern Russia, but came over to Manitoba to escape
the conscription. They number upwards of 15,000. About
4000 French Canadians, who had emigrated from Quebec to
the United States, have also made the province their home,
as well as Icelanders now numbering 20,000. During the
decade ending 1907 large reserves were settled with Ruthenians
often known as Galicians, Poles and other peoples from central
and northern Europe. Some 30,000 of these are found in the
province. The remainder of the population is chiefly made up
of English-speaking people from the other provinces of the
Dominion, from the United States, from England and Scotland
and the north of Ireland.</p>

<p><i>Religion.</i>&mdash;Classified according to religion, the various denominations
were, in 1901, as follows: Presbyterians, 65,310;
Episcopalians, 44,874; Methodists, 49,909; Roman Catholics,
35,622; Baptists, 9098; Lutherans, 16,473; Mennonites, 15,222;
Greek Catholics, 7898; other denominations, 9903; not specified,
638.</p>

<p><i>Government.</i>&mdash;The province is under a lieutenant-governor,
appointed for a term of five years, with an executive council
of six members, responsible to the local legislature, which consists
of forty-two members. It has four members in the Canadian
Senate and ten in the House of Commons.</p>

<p><i>Education.</i>&mdash;The dual system of education, established in
1871, was abolished in 1890, and the administrative machinery
consolidated under a minister of the Crown and an advisory
board. This act was amended in 1897 to meet the wishes of
the Roman Catholic minority, but separate schools were not re-established;
nor was the council divided into denominational
committees. There are collegiate institutes for more advanced
education at Winnipeg, Brandon and Portage la Prairie, with
a total of 1094 pupils enrolled. There is also a normal school
at Winnipeg for the training of teachers. Higher education is
represented by the provincial university, which teaches science
and mathematics, holds examinations, distributes scholarships,
and grants degrees in all subjects. It has affiliated to it colleges
of the Roman Catholic, Episcopalian, Presbyterian and
Methodist denominations, with medical and pharmaceutical
colleges. The arts colleges of the churches carry on the several
courses required by the university, and send their students
to the examinations of the university. A well-equipped
agricultural college near Winnipeg is provided for sons and
daughters of farmers.</p>

<p><i>Agriculture</i> is the prevailing industry of Manitoba. Dairy-farming
is rapidly increasing in importance, and creameries
for the manufacture of butter and cheese are established in
almost all parts of the province. Large numbers of horses,
cattle, swine and poultry are reared. The growth of cereals is
the largest department of agriculture followed.</p>

<p class="noind">These figures do not include the wheat ground into flour and sent
by way of British Columbia to Asia and Australia, nor the wheat
retained by the farmers for seed. The Dominion government
maintains an experimental farm of 670 acres at Brandon. The
fisheries are all fresh-water, principally white-fish, pickerel and pike.
Large quantities of fresh fish caught in lakes Winnipeg and Manitoba
are exported to all parts of the United States.</p>

<p><i>Communications.</i>&mdash;The region of the Red River and Assiniboine
valleys was opened up by the fur traders, who came by the waterways
from Lake Superior, and afterwards by the water communication
with Hudson Bay. While these early traders used the canoe
and the York boat,<a name="fa1p" id="fa1p" href="#ft1p"><span class="sp">1</span></a> yet the steamboat played an important part
in the early history of the region from 1868 till 1885, when access
from the United States was gained by steamers down the Red River.
The completion of the St Andrew&rsquo;s Rapids canal on Red River,
and the Grand Rapids canal on the Saskatchewan river will again
give an impetus to inland navigation on the tributaries of Lake
Winnipeg. Lake Manitoba also affords opportunity for inland
shipping.</p>

<p>The broad expanse of prairie-land in the western provinces of
Canada is well suited for the cheap and expeditious building of
railways. The first connexion with the United States was by two
railways coming down the Red River valley. But the desire for
Canadian unity led the Dominion to assist a transcontinental line
connecting Manitoba with eastern Canada. The building of the
Canadian Pacific railway through almost continuous rocks for 800
miles was one of the greatest engineering feats of modern times.
Immediately on the formation of the Canadian Pacific railway
company branch lines were begun at Winnipeg and there are eight
radial lines running from this centre to all parts of the country. Winnipeg
is thus connected with Montreal on the east, and Vancouver
on the west, and is the central point of the Canadian Pacific system,
having railway yards and equipment equalled by few places in
America. In opposition to the Canadian Pacific railway a southern
line was built from Winnipeg to the American boundary. This fell
into the hands of the Northern Pacific railway, but was purchased
by the promoters of the Canadian Northern railway. This railway
has six radiating lines leaving the city of Winnipeg, and its main
line connects Port Arthur on Lake Superior with Edmonton in the
west. The Canadian Northern railway has a remarkable network
of railways connecting Winnipeg with every corner of Manitoba.
The Great Northern railway has also three branch lines in Manitoba
and one of these has Winnipeg as its terminus. The grand Trunk
Pacific railway, the great transcontinental line promoted by the
Laurier government, passes through Manitoba north of the Canadian
Pacific, coming from the east deflects southward to pass through
Winnipeg, and then strikes northward in a direct line of easy
gradients to find its way through the Rocky Mountains to its
terminus of Prince Rupert on the north coast of British Columbia.</p>
</div>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;The first white settlement in Manitoba was made
by Pierre Gaultier de Varennes, Sieur de la Verendrye (d. 1749),
who, gradually pushing westward from Lake Superior, reached
Lake Winnipeg in 1733, and in the following year built a fort
not far from the present Fort Alexander. In October 1738
he built another at Fort Rouge, at the junction of the Red
and Assiniboine rivers, where is now the city of Winnipeg.
After the British conquest of 1763 the west became the scene
of a rapidly increasing fur trade, and for many years there was
keen rivalry between the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company, with its
headquarters in England, and the North-West Company of
Montreal. French and Scottish farmers and fur-traders gradually
settled along the Red River, and by their frequent marriages
with the Indians produced a race of metis or half-breeds.
From 1811 to 1818 Lord Selkirk&rsquo;s attempted colonization
greatly increased the population; from the time of his failure
till 1869 the settlers lived quietly under the mild rule of the
Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company. In that year the newly formed
Dominion of Canada bought from the company its territorial
and political rights. A too hasty occupation by Canadian
officials and settlers led to the rebellion of the Metis under
Louis Riel, a native leader. The rebellion was quieted and
Sir Garnet Wolseley (now Lord Wolseley) was sent from Canada
by the lake route, with several regiments of troops&mdash;regulars
and volunteers. The Manitoba Act constituting the province
was passed by the Canadian parliament in 1870. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Red
River Settlement</a></span>; and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Riel, Louis</a></span>.)</p>

<p>The admixture of races and religions, and its position as the
key to the great West, have ever since made Manitoba the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page586" id="page586"></a>586</span>
storm centre of Canadian politics. In the charter granted
by the Canadian parliament to the Canadian Pacific railway a
clause giving it for twenty years control over the railway
construction of the province led to a fierce agitation, till the
clause was repealed in 1888. Till 1884 an equally fierce agitation
was carried on against Ontario with regard to the eastern
boundary of Manitoba. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Ontario</a></span>.) In both these disputes
the provincial leader was the Hon. John Norquay, in whose
veins ran a large admixture of Indian blood. In 1890 changes
in the school system unfavourable to the Roman Catholic
Church led to a constitutional struggle, to which was due the
defeat of the Federal ministry in 1896. Since 1896 its rapid
material progress has produced numerous economic problems
and disputes, many of which are still unsolved.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MANITOWOC<a name="ar116" id="ar116"></a></span> (Indian, &ldquo;Spirit-land&rdquo;), a city and the county-seat
of Manitowoc county, Wisconsin, on the W. shore of Lake
Michigan, 75 m. N. of Milwaukee. Pop. (1890), 7710; (1900),
11,786, of whom 2998 were foreign-born; (1910 census),
13,027. It is served by the Chicago &amp; North-Western,
and the Wisconsin Central railways; by ferry across the lake to
Frankfort, Mich., and Ludington, Mich.; by the Ann Arbor
and the Père Marquette railways; and by the Goodrich line
of lake steamers. The city is finely situated on high ground
above the lake at the mouth of the Manitowoc river. At
Manitowoc are the county insane asylum and a Polish
orphan asylum. The city has a training school for county
teachers, a business college, two hospitals and a Carnegie
library. There are ship-yards for the construction of both
steel and wooden vessels, and several grain elevators. The
value of the factory products increased from $1,935,442 in
1900 to $4,427,816 in 1905, or 128.8 per cent.&mdash;a greater increase
than that of any other city in the state during this period. There
is a good harbour, and the city has a considerable lake commerce
in grain, flour, and dairy products. Jacques Vieau established
here a post for the North-west Company of fur traders in 1795.
The first permanent settlement was made about 1836, and Manitowoc
was chartered as a city in 1870. In Manitowoc county,
18 m. south-west of the city of Manitowoc, is St Nazianz,
an unorganized village near which in 1854 a colony or
community of German Roman Catholics was established
under the leadership of Father Ambrose Oswald, the primary
object being to enable poor people by combination and co-operation
to supply themselves with the comforts of life at
minimum expense and have as much time as possible left for
religious thought and worship. The title of the colony&rsquo;s land
was vested in Father Oswald after the panic of 1857 until his
death in 1874, when he devised the lands to &ldquo;the colony founded
by me.&rdquo; The colony had no legal existence at the time, but
was then incorporated as the &ldquo;Roman Catholic Religious Society
of St Nazianz,&rdquo; and as such sued successfully for the bequest.
Financially the colony was successful, but as there were some
desertions and no new recruits after Father Oswald&rsquo;s death,
there were few members by 1909. There are no longer
any traces of communism, and the colony&rsquo;s property is
actually held by an organization of the local Roman Catholic
church.</p>

of Minneapolis. Pop. (1890), 8838; (1900), 10,599, of whom
2578 were foreign-born; (1910 census), 10,365. Mankato is
served by the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Omaha, the
Chicago &amp; North-Western (both &ldquo;North-Western Lines&rdquo;), the
Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St Paul, and the Chicago Great-Western
railways. The city has two fine parks, a Carnegie library, a
Federal building, the Immanuel and St Joseph hospitals, two
commercial colleges, and a state normal school (1868). The
numerous lakes in the neighbourhood, particularly Lake Madison
and Lake Washington, are widely known as summer resorts.
Four miles west of the city is Minneopa state park (area, 60
acres), in which are Minneopa Falls (60 ft.) and a fine gorge;
the park was established by the state in 1905-1906. Mankato
has an extensive trade in dairy and agricultural products
(especially grain), stone (a pinkish buff limestone is quarried in
the vicinity), and forest products. The value of its factory
products increased from $1,887,315 in 1900 to $3,422,117 in
1905, or 81.3%.</p>

<p>Mankato was settled about 1853, and was first chartered as
a city in 1868. On or near the site of the city stood a village
of the Mankato (&ldquo;blue earth&rdquo;) band of the Mdewakanton
Sioux, who derived their name from one of their chiefs, &ldquo;Old
Mankato.&rdquo; In this region occurred the Sioux uprising of
1862, and from this point operations were carried on which
eventually resulted in the subjugation of the Indians and the
hanging, at Mankato, in December 1862, of 38 leaders of the
revolt. In the uprising the Mankato band was led by another
chief named Mankato, who took part in the attack on Ft
Ridgeley, Minn., in August, in the engagement on the 3rd of
September at Birch Coolie, Minn., and in that on the 23rd of
September at Wood Lake, where he was killed.</p>

a mock marriage with a kinsman who deserted her basely three
years afterwards. She was patronized for a short time by the
duchess of Cleveland, and wrote an unsuccessful comedy, <i>The
Lost Lover</i> (1696); in freedom of speech she equalled the most
licentious writers of comedy in that generation. Her tragedy,
<i>The Royal Mischief</i> (1696) was more successful. From 1696 Mrs
Manley was a favourite member of witty and fashionable society.
In 1705 appeared <i>The Secret History of Queen Zarah and the
Zarazians</i>, a satire on Sarah, duchess of Marlborough, in the
guise of romance. This was probably by Mrs Manley, who,
four years later, achieved her principal triumph as a writer
by her <i>Secret Memoirs ... of Several Persons of Quality</i>
(1709), a scandalous chronicle &ldquo;from the New Atalantis, an
island in the Mediterranean.&rdquo; She was arrested in the autumn
of 1709 as the author of a libellous publication, but was discharged
by the court of queen&rsquo;s bench on the 13th of February
1710. Mrs Manley sought in this scandalous narrative to
expose the private vices of the ministers whom Swift, Bolingbroke
and Harley combined to drive from office. During the keen
political campaign in 1711 she wrote several pamphlets, and
many numbers of the <i>Examiner</i>, criticizing persons and policy
with equal vivacity. Later were published her tragedy <i>Lucius</i>
(1717); <i>The Power of Love, in Seven Novels</i> (1720), and <i>A Stage
Coach Journey to Exeter</i> (1725).</p>

<p><span class="bold">MANLIUS,<a name="ar120" id="ar120"></a></span> the name of a Roman gens, chiefly patrician,

<p>1. <span class="sc">Marcus Manlius Capitolinus</span>, a patrician, consul 392 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>
According to tradition, when in 390 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> the besieging Gauls
were attempting to scale the Capitol, he was roused by the
cackling of the sacred geese, rushed to the spot and threw down
the foremost assailants (Livy v. 47; Plutarch, <i>Camillus</i>, 27).
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page587" id="page587"></a>587</span>
Several years after, seeing a centurion led to prison for debt,
he freed him with his own money, and even sold his estate
to relieve other poor debtors, while he accused the senate of
embezzling public money. He was charged with aspiring to
kingly power, and condemned by the comitia, but not until
the assembly had adjourned to a place without the walls, where
they could no longer see the Capitol which he had saved. His
house on the Capitol (the origin of his surname) was razed, and
the Manlii resolved that henceforth no patrician Manlius should
bear the name of Marcus. According to Mommsen, the story
of the saving of the Capitol was a later invention to explain
his surname, and his attempt to relieve the debtors a fiction
of the times of Cinna.</p>

(353, 349 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) and three times consul (347, 344, 340). When
his father, L. Manlius Imperiosus (dictator 363), was brought
to trial by the tribune M. Pomponius for abusing his office of
dictator, he forced Pomponius to drop the accusation by threatening
his life (Livy vii. 3-5). In 360, during a war with the
Gauls, he slew one of the enemy, a man of gigantic stature,
in single combat, and took from him a torques (neck-ornament),
whence his surname. When the Latins demanded an equal
share in the government of the confederacy, Manlius vowed
to kill with his own hand the first Latin he saw in the senate-house.
The Latins and Campanians revolted, and Manlius,
consul for the third time, marched into Campania and gained
two great victories, near Vesuvius, where P. Decius Mus (<i>q.v.</i>),
his colleague, &ldquo;devoted&rdquo; himself in order to gain the day,
and at Trifanum. In this campaign Manlius executed his
own son, who had killed an enemy in single combat, and thus
disobeyed the express command of the consuls.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MANN, HORACE<a name="ar121" id="ar121"></a></span> (1796-1859), American educationist, was
born in Franklin, Massachusetts, on the 4th of May 1796.
His childhood and youth were passed in poverty, and his health
was early impaired by hard manual labour. His only means
for gratifying his eager desire for books was the small library
founded in his native town by Benjamin Franklin and consisting
principally of histories and treatises on theology. At the age
of twenty he was fitted, in six months, for college, and in 1819,
graduated with highest honours, from the Brown University at
Providence, Rhode Island, having devoted himself so unremittingly
to his studies as to weaken further his naturally feeble
constitution. He then studied law for a short time at Wrentham,
Massachusetts; was tutor in Latin and Greek (1820-1822) and
librarian (1821-1823) at Brown University; studied during 1821-1823
in the famous law school conducted by Judge James Gould
at Litchfield, Connecticut; and in 1823 was admitted to the
Norfolk (Mass.) bar. For fourteen years, first at Dedham,
Massachusetts, and after 1833 at Boston, he devoted himself,
with great success, to his profession. Meanwhile he served,
with conspicuous <span class="correction" title="amended from ailbity">ability</span>, in the Massachusetts House of Representatives
from 1827 to 1833 and in the Massachusetts Senate
from 1833 to 1837, for the last two years as president. It was not
until he became secretary (1837) of the newly created board of
education of Massachusetts, that he began the work which
was soon to place him in the foremost rank of American
educationists. He held this position till 1848, and worked with
a remarkable intensity&mdash;holding teachers&rsquo; conventions, delivering
numerous lectures and addresses, carrying on an extensive
correspondence, introducing numerous reforms, planning and
inaugurating the Massachusetts normal school system, founding
and editing <i>The Common School Journal</i> (1838), and preparing
a series of <i>Annual Reports</i>, which had a wide circulation and
are still considered as being &ldquo;among the best expositions,
if, indeed, they are not the very best ones, of the practical
benefits of a common school education both to the individual
and to the state&rdquo; (Hinsdale). The practical result of his
work was the virtual revolutionizing of the common school
system of Massachusetts, and indirectly of the common
school systems of other states. In carrying out his work he
met with bitter opposition, being attacked particularly by
certain school-masters of Boston who strongly disapproved of
his pedagogical theories and innovations, and by various
religious sectaries, who contended against the exclusion of
all sectarian instruction from the schools. He answered
these attacks in kind, sometimes perhaps with unnecessary
vehemence and rancour, but he never faltered in his work,
and, an optimist by nature, a disciple of his friend George
Combe (<i>q.v.</i>), and a believer in the indefinite improvability of
mankind, he was sustained throughout by his conviction that
nothing could so much benefit the race, morally, intellectually
and materially, as education. Resigning the secretaryship
in 1848, he was elected to the national House of Representatives,
as an anti-slavery Whig to succeed John Quincy Adams, and
was re-elected in 1849, and, as an independent candidate, in
1850, serving until March 1853. In 1852 he was the candidate
of the Free-soilers for the governorship of Massachusetts, but
was defeated. In Congress he was one of the ablest opponents
of slavery, contending particularly against the Compromise
Measures of 1850, but he was never technically an Abolitionist and
he disapproved of the Radicalism of Garrison and his followers.
From 1853 until his death, on the second of August 1859, he
was president of the newly established Antioch College at Yellow
Springs, Ohio, where he taught political economy, intellectual
and moral philosophy, and natural theology. The college
received insufficient financial support and suffered from the
attacks of religious sectaries&mdash;he himself was charged with
insincerity because, previously a Unitarian, he joined the
Christian Connexion, by which the college was founded&mdash;but he
earned the love of his students, and by his many addresses exerted
a beneficial influence upon education in the Middle West.</p>

<p>A collected edition of Mann&rsquo;s writings, together with a memoir
(1 vol.) by his second wife, Mary Peabody Mann, a sister of Miss

<p><span class="bold">MANNA,<a name="ar122" id="ar122"></a></span> a concrete saccharine exudation obtained by making
incisions on the trunk of the flowering or manna ash tree, <i>Fraxinus
Ornus</i>. The manna ash is a small tree found in Italy, and
extending to Switzerland, South Tirol, Hungary, Greece, Turkey
and Asia Minor. It also grows in the islands of Sicily, Corsica
and Sardinia. It blossoms early in summer, producing numerous
clusters of whitish flowers. At the present day the manna of
commerce is collected exclusively in Sicily from cultivated trees,
chiefly in the districts around Capaci, Carini, Cinisi and Favarota,
small towns 20 to 25 m. W. of Palermo, and in the townships of
Geraci, Castelbuono, and other places in the district of Cefalù,
50 to 70 m. E. of Palermo. In the <i>frassinetti</i> or plantations the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page588" id="page588"></a>588</span>
trees are placed about 7 ft. apart, and after they are eight years
old, and the trunk at least 3 in. in diameter, the collection of
manna is begun. This operation is performed in July or August
during the dry weather, by making transverse incisions 1½ to 2 in.
long, and about 1 in. apart, through the bark, one cut being made
each day, the first at the bottom of the tree, another directly
above the first, and so on. In succeeding years the process is
repeated on the untouched sides of the trunk, until the tree has
been cut all round and exhausted. It is then cut down, and a
young plant arising from the same root takes its place. The
finest or flaky manna appears to have been allowed to harden
on the stem. A very superior kind, obtained by allowing the
juice to encrust pieces of wood or straws inserted in the cuts, is
called <i>manna a cannolo</i>. The fragments adhering to the stem,
after the finest flakes have been removed are scraped off, and
form the small or Tolfa manna of commerce. That which flows
from the lower incisions is often collected on tiles or on a concave
piece of the prickly pear (<i>Opunlia</i>), but is less crystalline and
more glutinous, and is less esteemed.</p>

<p>Manna of good quality dissolves at ordinary temperatures in
about 6 parts of water, forming a clear liquid. Its chief constituent
is mannite or manna sugar, a hexatomic alcohol, C<span class="su">6</span>H<span class="su">8</span>(OH)<span class="su">6</span>,
which likewise occurs, in much smaller quantity, in certain species
of the brown seaweed, <i>Fucus</i>, and in plants of several widely
separated natural orders. Mannite is obtained by extracting
manna with alcohol and crystallizing the solution. The best
manna contains 70 to 80%. It crystallizes in shining rhombic
prisms from its aqueous solution and as delicate needles from
alcohol. Manna possesses mildly laxative properties, and on
account of its sweet taste is employed as a mild aperient for
children. It is less used in England now than formerly, but is
still largely consumed in South America. In Italy mannite is
prepared for sale in the shape of small cones resembling loaf
sugar in shape, and is frequently prescribed in medicine instead
of manna.</p>

<p>The manna of the present day appears to have been unknown
before the 15th century, although a mountain in Sicily with the
Arabic name Gibelman, <i>i.e.</i> &ldquo;manna mountain,&rdquo; appears to
point to its collection there during the period that the island was
held by the Saracens, 827-1070. In the 16th century it was
collected in Calabria, and until recently was produced in the
Tuscan Maremma, but none is now brought into commerce from
Italy, although the name of Tolfa, a town near Civita Vecchia, is
still applied to an inferior variety of the drug.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Various other kinds of manna are known, but none of these has
been found to contain mannite. Alhagi manna (Persian and Arabic
<i>tar-angub&#299;n</i>, also known as terendschabin) is the produce of <i>Alhagi
maurorum</i>, a small, spiny, leguminous plant, growing in Arabia, Asia
Minor, Persia, Afghanistan, Baluchistan and northern India. This
manna occurs in the form of small, roundish, hard, dry tears, varying
from the size of a mustard seed to that of a coriander, of a light-brown
colour, sweet taste, and senna-like odour. The spines and
pods of the plant are often mixed with it. It is collected near Kandahar
and Herat, and imported into India from Cabul and Kandahar.
Tamarisk manna (Persian <i>gaz-angub&#299;n</i>, tamarisk honey) exudes in
June and July from the slender branches of <i>Tamarix gallica</i>, var.
<i>mannifera</i>, in the form of honey-like drops, which, in the cold temperature
of the early morning, are found in the solid state. This
secretion is caused by the puncture of an insect, <i>Coccus manniparus</i>.
In the valleys of the peninsula of Sinai, especially in the W&#257;dy el-Sheikh,
this manna (Arabic <i>man</i>) is collected by the Arabs and sold
to the monks of St Catherine, who supply it to the pilgrims visiting
the convent. It is found also in Persia and the Punjab, but does
not appear to be collected in any quantity. This kind of manna
seems to be alluded to by Herodotus (vii. 31). Under the same
name of <i>gaz-angub&#299;n</i> there are sold commonly in the Persian bazaars
round cakes, of which a chief ingredient is a manna obtained to the
south-west of Ispahan, in the month of August, by shaking the
branches or scraping the stems of <i>Astragalus florulentus</i> and <i>A.
adscendens</i>.<a name="fa1q" id="fa1q" href="#ft1q"><span class="sp">1</span></a> <i>Shir Khist</i>, a manna known to writers on materia
medica in the 16th century, is imported into India from Afghanistan
and Turkestan to a limited extent; it is the produce of <i>Cotoneaster
nummularia</i> (<i>Rosaceae</i>), and to a less extent of <i>Atraphaxis spinosa</i>
(<i>Polygonaceae</i>); it is brought chiefly from Herat.</p>

<p>Oak manna or <i>Gueze-elefi</i>, according to Haussknecht, is collected
from the twigs of <i>Quercus Vallonia</i> and <i>Q. persica</i>, on which it is
produced by the puncture of an insect during the month of August.
This manna occurs in the state of agglutinated tears, and forms an
object of some industry among the wandering tribes of Kurdistan.
It is collected before sunrise, by shaking the grains of manna on to
linen cloths spread out beneath the trees, or by dipping the small
branches in hot water and evaporating the solution thus obtained.
A substance collected by the inhabitants of Laristan from <i>Pyrus
glabra</i> strongly resembles oak manna in appearance.</p>

<p>Australian or Eucalyptus manna is found on the leaves of <i>Eucalyptus
viminalis</i>, <i>E. Gunnii</i>, var. <i>rubida</i>, <i>E. pulverulenta</i>, &amp;c. The Lerp
manna of Australia is of animal origin.</p>

<p>Briançon manna is met with on the leaves of the common Larch
(<i>q.v.</i>), and <i>bide-khecht</i> on those of the willow, <i>Salix fragilis</i>; and a
kind of manna was at one time obtained from the cedar.</p>

<p>The manna of the Biblical narrative, notwithstanding the miraculous
circumstances which distinguish it from anything now known,
answers in its description very closely to the tamarisk manna.</p>

of Economic Products of India</i>, under &ldquo;Manna&rdquo; (1891). For analyses

real name was Southcote Mansergh, was born in London, son of
Colonel Mansergh, an Irishman. He had a fine bass voice, and
was educated for the musical profession in Dublin and at the
Royal Academy of Music in London. He began singing in
opera in 1881, and in 1882 had great success as the sentry in
<i>Iolanthe</i> at the Savoy, following this with numerous engagements
in opera both in England and America. He married the singer
Fanny Moody, already a leading soprano on the operatic stage,
in 1890; and in 1897 they formed the Moody-Manners opera
company, which had a great success in the provinces and undertook
seasons in London in 1902. Manners and his wife were
assisted by some other excellent artists, and their enterprise had

He was consecrated bishop of Norwich in 1792, and
two years later received the appointment of dean of Windsor

Moore in the see of Canterbury. During his primacy the old
archiepiscopal palace at Croydon was sold and the country palace
of Addington bought with the proceeds. He presided over the

He also exerted himself to promote the establishment of the

<p><span class="bold">MANNHEIM,<a name="ar125" id="ar125"></a></span> a town of Germany, in the grand-duchy of
Baden, lying on the right bank of the Rhine, at its confluence
with the Neckar, 39 m. by rail N. of Karlsruhe, 10 m. W. of
Heidelberg and 55 m. S. of Frankfort-on-Main. Pop. (1900),
141,131; (1905), 162,607 (of whom about 70,000 are Roman
Catholics and 6000 Jews). It is perhaps the most regularly
built town in Germany, consisting of twelve parallel streets
intersected at right angles by others, which cut it up into 136
square sections of equal size. These blocks are distinguished,
after the American fashion, by letters and numerals. Except on
the south side all the streets debouch on the promenade, which
forms a circle round the town on the site of the old ramparts.
Outside this ring are the suburbs Schwetzinger-Vorstadt to the
south and Neckar-Vorstadt to the north, others being Lindenhof,
Mühlau, Neckarau and Käferthal. Mannheim is connected by a
handsome bridge with Ludwigshafen, a rapidly growing commercial
and manufacturing town on the left bank of the Rhine, in
Bavarian territory. The Neckar is spanned by two bridges.</p>

<p>Nearly the whole of the south-west side of the town is occupied
by the palace (1720-1759), formerly the residence of the elector
palatine of the Rhine. It is one of the largest buildings of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page589" id="page589"></a>589</span>
kind in Germany, covering an area of 15 acres, and having a
frontage of about 600 yards. It has 1500 windows. The left
wing was totally destroyed by the bombardment of 1795, but
has since been restored. The palace contains a picture gallery
and collections of natural history and antiquities, and in front of
it are two monumental fountains and a monument to the emperor
William I. The large and beautiful gardens at the back form
the public park of the town. Among the other prominent buildings
arc the theatre, the arsenal, the synagogue, the &ldquo;Kaufhaus,&rdquo;
the town-hall (<i>Rathaus</i>, 1771) and the observatory. A newer
building is the fine municipal Festhalle with magnificent rooms.
The only noteworthy churches are the Jesuit church (1737-1760),
the interior of which is lavishly decorated with marble
and painting; the Koncordienkirche and the Schlosskirche.
In front of the theatre are statues of Schiller, August Wilhelm
Iffland the actor, and Wolfgang Heribert von Dalberg (1750-1806),
intendant of the theatre in the time of Schiller. Mannheim
is the chief commercial town on the upper Rhine, and yields in
importance to Cologne alone among the lower Rhenish towns.
It stands at the head of the effective navigation on the Rhine, and
is not only the largest port on the upper course of that stream,
but is the principal emporium for south Germany for such commodities
as cereals, coal, petroleum, timber, sugar and tobacco,
with a large trade in hops, wine and other south German produce.
Owing to the rapid increase in the traffic, a new harbour at the
mouth of the Neckar was opened in 1898. The industries are
equal in importance to the transit trade, and embrace metal-working,
iron-founding and machine building, the manufacture
of electric plant, celluloid, automobiles, furniture, cables
and chemicals, sugar refining, cigar and tobacco making, and
brewing.</p>

<p>Mannheim is the seat of the central board for the navigation
of the Rhine, of a high court of justice, and of the grand ducal
commissioner for north Baden.</p>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;The name of Mannheim was connected with its
present site in the 8th century, when a small village belonging
to the abbey of Lorsch lay in the marshy district between the
Neckar and the Rhine. To the south of this village, on the
Rhine, was the castle of Eicholzheim, which acquired some
celebrity as the place of confinement assigned to Pope John
XXIII. by the council of Constance. The history of modern
Mannheim begins, however, with the opening of the 17th century,
when the elector palatine Frederick IV. founded a town here,
which was peopled chiefly with Protestant refugees from Holland.
The strongly fortified castle which he erected at the same time
had the unfortunate result of making the infant town an object
of contention in the Thirty Years&rsquo; War, during which it was five
times taken and retaken. In 1688 Mannheim, which had in the
meantime recovered from its former disasters, was captured by
the French, and in 1689 it was burned down. Ten years later
it was rebuilt on an extended scale, and provided with fortifications
by the elector John William. For its subsequent importance
it was indebted to the elector Charles Philip, who, owing
to ecclesiastical disputes, transferred his residence from Heidelberg
to Mannheim in 1720. It remained the capital of the Palatinate
for nearly sixty years, being especially flourishing under
the elector Charles Theodore. In 1794 Mannheim fell into the
hands of the French, and in the following year it was retaken by
the Austrians after a severe bombardment, which left scarcely
a single building uninjured. In 1803 it was assigned to the grand
duke of Baden, who caused the fortifications to be razed. Towards
the end of the 18th century Mannheim attained great
celebrity in the literary world as the place where Schiller&rsquo;s early
plays were performed for the first time. It was at Mannheim
that Kotzebue was assassinated in 1819. During the revolution
in Baden in 1849 the town was for a time in the hands of the
insurgents, and was afterwards occupied by the Prussians.</p>

mother, Mary, daughter of Henry Leroy Hunter, of Beech Hill,
Reading, was of a family said to be of French extraction. Manning&rsquo;s
boyhood was mainly spent at Coombe Bank, Sundridge,
Kent, where he had for companions Charles and Christopher
Wordsworth, afterwards bishops of St Andrews and of Lincoln.
He was educated at Harrow, 1822-1827, Dr G. Butler being
then the head master, but obtained no distinction beyond being
in the cricket eleven in 1825. He matriculated at Balliol College,
Oxford, in 1827, and soon made his mark as a debater at the
Union, where Gladstone succeeded him as president in 1830.
At this date he was ambitious of a political career, but his father
had sustained severe losses in business, and in these circumstances
Manning, having graduated with first-class honours in 1830,
obtained the year following, through Viscount Goderich, a post
as supernumerary clerk in the colonial office. This, however,
he resigned in 1832, his thoughts having been turned towards a
clerical career under Evangelical influences, which affected him
deeply throughout life. Returning to Oxford, he was elected a
fellow of Merton College, and was ordained; and in 1833 he was
presented to the rectory of Lavington-with-Graffham in Sussex
by Mrs Sargent, whose granddaughter Caroline he married on
the 7th of November 1833, the ceremony being performed by the
bride&rsquo;s brother-in-law, Samuel Wilberforce, afterwards bishop
of Oxford and of Winchester. Manning&rsquo;s married life was of
brief duration. His young and beautiful wife was of a consumptive
family, and died childless (July 24, 1837). The
lasting sadness that thus early overshadowed him tended to
facilitate his acceptance of the austere teaching of the Oxford
Tracts; and though he was never an acknowledged disciple of
Newman, it was due to the latter&rsquo;s influence that from this date
his theology assumed an increasingly High Church character,
and his printed sermon on the &ldquo;Rule of Faith&rdquo; was taken as a
public profession of his alliance with the Tractarians. In 1838 he
took a leading part in the Church education movement, by which
diocesan boards were established throughout the country; and he
wrote an open letter to his bishop in criticism of the recent
appointment of the ecclesiastical commission. In December
of that year he paid his first visit to Rome, and called on Dr
Wiseman in company with W. E. Gladstone. In January 1841
Shuttleworth, bishop of Chichester, appointed him archdeacon,
whereupon he began a personal visitation of each parish within
his district, completing the task in 1843. In 1842 he published
a treatise on <i>The Unity of the Church</i>, and his reputation as an
eloquent and earnest preacher being by this time considerable,
he was in the same year appointed select preacher by his university,
thus being called upon to fill from time to time the pulpit
which Newman, as vicar of St Mary&rsquo;s, was just ceasing to occupy.
Four volumes of his sermons appeared between the years 1842
and 1850, and these had reached the 7th, 4th, 3rd and 2nd editions
respectively in 1850, but were not afterwards reprinted.
In 1844 his portrait was painted by Richmond, and the same
year he published a volume of university sermons, in which,
however, was not included the one on the Gunpowder Plot.
This sermon had much annoyed Newman and his more advanced
disciples, but it was a proof that at that date Manning was loyal
to the Church of England as Protestant. Newman&rsquo;s secession
in 1845 placed Manning in a position of greater responsibility,
as one of the High Church leaders, along with Pusey and Keble
and Marriott; but it was with Gladstone and James Hope (afterwards
Hope-Scott) that he was at this time most closely associated.
In the spring of 1847 he was seriously ill, and that autumn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page590" id="page590"></a>590</span>
and the following winter he spent abroad, chiefly in Rome,
where he saw Newman &ldquo;wearing the Oratorian habit and dead
to the world.&rdquo; He had public and private audiences with the
pope on the 9th of April and the 11th of May 1848, but recorded
next to nothing in his diary concerning them, though numerous
other entries show an eager interest in everything connected
with the Roman Church, and private papers also indicate that
he recognized at this time grave defects in the Church of England
and a mysterious attractiveness in Roman Catholicism, going
so far as to question whether he might not one day be a Roman
Catholic himself. Returning to England, he protested, but with
moderation, against the appointment of Hampden as bishop of
Hereford, and continued to take an active part in the religious
education controversy. Through the influence of Samuel
Wilberforce, he was offered the post of sub-almoner to Queen
Victoria, always recognized as a stepping-stone to the episcopal
bench, and his refusal of it was honourably consonant with all
else in his career as an Anglican dignitary, in which he united
pastoral diligence with an asceticism that was then quite exceptional.
In 1850 the decision of the privy council, that the bishop
of Exeter was bound to institute the Rev. G. C. Gorham to the
benefice of Brampford Speke in spite of the latter&rsquo;s acknowledged
disbelief in the doctrine of baptismal regeneration, brought to a
crisis the position within the Church of England of those who
believed in that Church as a legitimate part of the infallible
<i>Ecclesia docens</i>. Manning made it clear that he regarded the
matter as vital, though he did not act on this conviction until no
hope remained of the decision being set aside or practically annulled
by joint action of the bishops. In July he addressed to
his bishop an open letter on &ldquo;The Appellate Jurisdiction of the
Crown in Matters Spiritual,&rdquo; and he also took part in a meeting
in London which protested against the decision. In the autumn
of this year (1850) was the great popular outcry against the
&ldquo;Papal aggression&rdquo; (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Wiseman</a></span>), and Manning, feeling himself
unable to take part in this protest, resigned, early in December
his benefice and his archdeaconry; and writing to Hope-Scott,
who a little later became a Roman Catholic with him, stated his
conviction that the alternative was &ldquo;either Rome or licence of
thought and will.&rdquo; He was received into the Roman Catholic
Church by Father Brownbill, S.J., at the church in Farm Street,
on Passion Sunday, the 6th of April 1851. On the following
Sunday he was confirmed and received to communion by Cardinal
Wiseman, who also, within ten weeks of his reception, ordained
him priest. Manning thereupon proceeded to Rome to pursue
his theological studies, residing at the college known as the
&ldquo;Academy for Noble Ecclesiastics,&rdquo; and attending lectures by
Perrone and Passaglia among others. The pope frequently
received him in private audience, and in 1854 conferred on him
the degree of D.D. During his visits to England he was at the
disposal of Cardinal Wiseman, who through him, at the time of
the Crimean War, was enabled to obtain from the government the
concession that for the future Roman Catholic army chaplains
should not be regarded as part of the staff of the Protestant
chaplain-general. In 1857 the pope, <i>proprio motu</i>, appointed
him provost (or head of the chapter) of Westminster, and the
same year he took up his residence in Bayswater as superior
of a community known as the &ldquo;Oblates of St Charles,&rdquo; an association
of secular priests on the same lines as the institute of the
Oratory, but with this difference, that they are by their constitution
at the beck and call of the bishop in whose diocese they
live. The community was thus of the greatest service to Cardinal
Wiseman, whose right-hand man Manning thenceforward became.
During the eight years of his life at Bayswater he was
most active in all the duties of the priesthood, preaching, hearing
confessions, and receiving converts; and he was notably zealous
to promote in England all that was specially Roman and papal,
thus giving offence to old-fashioned Catholics, both clerical and
lay, many of whom were largely influenced by Gallican ideas,
and had with difficulty accepted the restoration of the hierarchy
in 1850. In 1860 he delivered a course of lectures on the pope&rsquo;s
temporal power, at that date seriously threatened, and shortly
afterwards he was appointed a papal domestic prelate, thus
becoming a &ldquo;Monsignor,&rdquo; to be addressed as &ldquo;Right Reverend.&rdquo;
He was now generally recognized as the able and effective leader
of the Ultramontane party among English Roman Catholics,
acting always, however, in subordination to Cardinal Wiseman;
and on the latter&rsquo;s death (Feb. 15, 1865) it was felt that, if
Manning should succeed to the vacant archbishopric, the triumph
of Ultramontanism would be secured. Such a consummation
not being desired by the Westminster chapter, they submitted
to the pope three names, and Manning&rsquo;s was not one of them.
Great efforts were made to secure the succession for the titular
archbishop Errington, who at one time had been Wiseman&rsquo;s
coadjutor with that right reserved to him, but who had been
ousted from that position by the pope acting under Manning&rsquo;s
influence. In such circumstances Pius IX. could hardly do
otherwise than ignore Errington&rsquo;s nomination, as he also ignored
the nomination of Clifford, bishop of Clifton, and of Grant, bishop
of Southwark; and, by what he humorously described as &ldquo;the
Lord&rsquo;s own <i>coup d&rsquo;état</i>,&rdquo; he appointed Manning to the archiepiscopal
see. Consecrated at the pro-cathedral at Moorfields
(since destroyed) by Dr Ullathorne, bishop of Birmingham
(June 8, 1865), and enthroned there (Nov. 6), after receiving the
<i>pallium</i> in Rome, Manning began his work as archbishop by
devoting himself especially to the religious education of the poor
and to the establishment of Catholic industrial and reformatory
schools. He steadily opposed whatever might encourage the
admission of Catholics to the national universities, and so put
his foot down on Newman&rsquo;s project to open a branch house of the
Oratory at Oxford with himself as superior. He made an unsuccessful
and costly effort to establish a Catholic university at
Kensington, and he also made provision for a diocesan seminary
of strictly ecclesiastical type. Jealous of the exclusive claims
of the Roman Church, he procured a further condemnation at
Rome of the &ldquo;Association for the Promotion of the Unity of
Christendom,&rdquo; which advocated prayers for the accomplishment
of a kind of federal union between the Roman, Greek and Anglican
Churches, and in a pastoral letter he insisted on the heretical
assumption implied in such an undertaking. He also worked for
the due recognition of the dignity of the secular or pastoral clergy,
whose position seemed to be threatened by the growing ascendancy
of the regulars, and especially of the Jesuits, whom, as a
practically distinct organization within the Church, he steadily
opposed. In addition to his diocesan synods, he presided in
1873 over the fourth provincial synod of Westminster, which
legislated on &ldquo;acatholic&rdquo; universities, church music, mixed marriages,
and the order of a priest&rsquo;s household, having previously
taken part, as theologian, in the provincial synods of 1853 and
1859, with a hand in the preparation of their decrees. But it
was chiefly through his strenuous advocacy of the policy of
defining papal infallibility at the Vatican council (1869-1870)
that Manning&rsquo;s name obtained world-wide renown. In this he
was instant in season and out of season. He brought to Rome a
petition in its favour from his chapter at Westminster, and during
the progress of the council he laboured incessantly to overcome
the opposition of the &ldquo;inopportunists.&rdquo; And he never ceased
to regard it as one of the chief privileges of his life that he had
been able to take an active part in securing the definition, and in
having heard with his own ears that doctrine proclaimed as a
part of divine revelation. In 1875 he published a reply to
Gladstone&rsquo;s attack on the Vatican decrees; and on the 15th of
March in that year he was created cardinal, with the title of
SS. Andrew and Gregory on the Coelian. He was present at the
death of Pius IX. (Feb. 7, 1878); and in the subsequent conclave,
while some Italian cardinals were prepared to vote for his
election to fill the vacant chair, he himself supported Cardinal
Pecci, afterwards known as Leo XIII. With him, however,
Manning found less sympathy than with his predecessor, though
Manning&rsquo;s advocacy of the claims of labour attracted Leo&rsquo;s
attention, and influenced the encyclical which he issued on the
subject. After the Vatican council, and more especially after the
death of Pius IX., Manning devoted his attention mainly to social
questions, and with these his name was popularly associated
during the last fifteen years of his life. From 1872 onwards he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page591" id="page591"></a>591</span>
was a strict teetotaller, not touching alcohol even as a medicine,
and there was some murmuring among his clergy that his teaching
on this subject verged on heresy. But his example and his
zeal profoundly influenced for good the Irish poor forming the
majority of his flock; and the &ldquo;League of the Cross&rdquo; which he
founded, and which held annual demonstrations at the Crystal
Palace, numbered nearly 30,000 members in London alone in
1874. He sat on two royal commissions, the one on the housing
of the working classes (1884), and the other on primary education
(1886); and in each case the report showed evident marks of his
influence, which his fellow-commissioners recognized as that of a
wise and competent social reformer. In the cause of labour he
was active for many years, and in 1872 he set an example to the
clergy of all the churches by taking a prominent part in a meeting
held in Exeter Hall on behalf of the newly established Agricultural
Labourers&rsquo; Union, Joseph Arch and Charles Bradlaugh
being among those who sat with him on the platform. In later
years his strenuous advocacy of the claims of the working
classes, and his declaration that &ldquo;every man has a right to
work or to bread&rdquo; led to his being denounced as a Socialist.
That he was such he denied more than once (Lemire, <i>Le Cardinal
Manning et son action sociale</i>, Paris, 1893, p. 210), nor was he
ever a Socialist in principle; but he favoured some of the
methods of Socialism, because they alone seemed to him practically
to meet the case of that pressing poverty which appealed
to his heart. He took a leading part in the settlement of the
dockers&rsquo; strike in the autumn of 1889, and his patient and
effectual action on this and on similar occasions secured for
him the esteem and affection of great numbers of working
men, so that his death on the 14th of January 1892, and his
funeral a week later, were the occasion for a remarkable
demonstration of popular veneration. The Roman Catholic
Cathedral at Westminster is his joint memorial with his
predecessor, Cardinal Wiseman.</p>

<p>Whatever may have been the value of Manning&rsquo;s services
to the Roman Catholic Church in England in bringing it, as
he did, up to a high level of what in earlier years was commonly
denounced as Ultramontanism, it is certain that by his
social action, as well as by the earnestness and holiness of his
life, he greatly advanced, in the minds of his countrymen generally,
their estimate of the character and value of Catholicism. Pre-eminently
he was a devout ecclesiastic, a &ldquo;great priest&rdquo;; and
his sermons, both Anglican and Catholic, are marked by fervour
and dignity, by a conviction of his own authoritative mission as
preacher, and by an eloquent insistence on considerations such
as warm the heart and bend the will rather than on such as force
the intellect to assent. But many of his instincts were those of a
statesman, a diplomatist, a man of the world, even of a business
man; and herein lay, at least in part, the secret of his influence
and success. Intellectually he did not stand in the front rank.
He was neither a philosopher nor a literary genius. Among his
many publications, written, it is only fair to admit, amidst the
urgent pressure of practical work, there is barely a page or even
a sentence that bears the stamp of immortality. But within a
somewhat narrower field he worked with patience, industry, and
self-denying zeal; his ambition, which seemed to many personal,
was rather the outcome of his devotion to the cause of the
Church; and in the later years of his life especially he showed
that he loved righteousness and hated iniquity, and that he
realized as clearly as any one that the service of God was
incomplete without the service of man.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The publication in 1896 of Manning&rsquo;s <i>Life</i>, by Purcell, was the
occasion for some controversy on the ethics of biography. Edward
Purcell was an obscure Catholic journalist, to whom Manning, late
in life, had entrusted, rather by way of charitable bequest, his private
diaries and other confidential papers. It thus came to pass that in
Purcell&rsquo;s voluminous biography much that was obviously never
intended for the public eye was, perhaps inadvertently, printed,
together with a good deal of ungenerous comment. The facts
disclosed which mainly attracted attention were: (1) that Manning,
while yet formally an Anglican, and while publicly and privately
dissuading others from joining the Roman Catholic Church, was yet
within a little convinced that it was his own duty and destiny to
take that step himself; (2) that he was continually intriguing at
the back-stairs of the Vatican for the furtherance of his own views
as to what was desirable in matters ecclesiastical; (3) that his relations
with Newman were very unfriendly; and (4) that, while for
the most part he exhibited towards his own clergy a frigid and
masterful demeanour, he held privately very cordial relations with
men of diverse religions or of no theological beliefs at all. And
certainly Manning does betray in these autobiographical fragments
an unheroic sensitiveness to the verdict of posterity on his career.
But independent critics (among whom may specially be named
François de Pressensé) held that Manning came well through the
ordeal, and that Purcell&rsquo;s <i>Life</i> had great value as an unintentionally
frank revelation of character.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MANNY, SIR WALTER DE MANNY,<a name="ar127" id="ar127"></a></span> <span class="sc">Baron de</span> (d. 1372),
soldier of fortune and founder of the Charterhouse, younger son
of Jean de Mauny, known as Le Borgne de Mauny, by his wife
Jeanne de Jenlain, was a native of Hainaut, from whose counts
he claimed descent. Manny&mdash;the name is thus spelt by most
English writers&mdash;was a patron and friend of Froissart, in whose
chronicles his exploits have a conspicuous and probably an
exaggerated place. He appears to have first come to England
as an esquire of Queen Philippa in 1327, and he took a distinguished
part in the Scottish wars of Edward III. In 1337 he
was placed in command of an English fleet, and in the following
year accompanied Edward to the continent, where in the
campaigns of the next few years he proved himself one of the
boldest and ablest of the English king&rsquo;s military commanders.
He was summoned to parliament as a baron by writ from the
12th of November 1347 to the 8th of January 1371. In 1359 he
was made a knight of the Garter; and at various times he received
extensive grants of land both in England and in France. He was
frequently employed by King Edward in the conduct of diplomatic
negotiations as well as in military commands. He was
one of those charged with the safe custody of the French king
John when a prisoner at Calais in 1360; in 1369 he was second
in command under John of Gaunt in his invasion of France.</p>

<p>But Manny is chiefly remembered for his share in the foundation
of the Charterhouse in London. In 1349 he bought some
acres of land near Smithfield, which were consecrated as a burying-place
where large numbers of the victims of the Black Death
were interred; and here he built a chapel, from which the place
obtained the name of &ldquo;Newchurchhaw.&rdquo; The chapel and ground
were bought from Manny by the bishop of London, Michael de
Northburgh, who died in 1361 and by his will bequeathed a large
sum of money to found there a Carthusian convent. It is not
clear whether this direction was ever carried out; for in 1371
Manny obtained letters patent from King Edward III. permitting
him to found, apparently on the same site, a Carthusian
monastery called &ldquo;La Salutation Mère Dieu,&rdquo; where the monks
were to pray for the soul of Northburgh as well as for the soul of
Manny himself. The bishop&rsquo;s bequest may have contributed
to the building and endowment of the house; or possibly, as
seems to be implied by a bull granted by Urban VI. in 1378,
there were originally two kindred establishments owing their
foundation to Northburgh and Manny respectively. At all
events Manny, who died early in 1372, left instructions that he
was to be buried in the church of the Carthusian monastery
founded by himself. About 1335 he married Margaret, daughter
and heiress of Thomas Plantagenet, earl of Norfolk, son of King
Edward I., whose first husband had been John, Lord Segrave.
This lady, who outlived Manny by many years, was countess of
Norfolk in her own right, and she was created duchess of Norfolk
in 1397. Manny left no surviving son. His daughter Anne,
Baroness de Manny in her own right, married John Hastings,
2nd earl of Pembroke; and on the death of her only son unmarried
in 1389, the barony of Manny became extinct.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MANNYNG, ROBERT<a name="ar128" id="ar128"></a></span> (<span class="sc">Robert of Brunne</span>) (<i>c.</i> 1264-1340?),
English poet, was a native of Brunne, now Bourne, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page592" id="page592"></a>592</span>
Lincolnshire. About 6 m. from Bourne was the Gilbertine
monastery of Sempringham, founded by Sir Gilbert de Sempringham
in 1139. The foundation provided for seven to thirteen
canons, with a number of lay brothers and a community of nuns.
No books were allowed to the lay brothers and nothing could be
written in the monastery without the prior&rsquo;s consent. Mannyng
entered this house in 1288, when, according to the rules, he must
have been at least 24 years of age, if, as is supposed, he was a
lay brother. He says he was at Cambridge with Robert de
Bruce and his two brothers, Thomas and Alexander, but this
does not necessarily imply that he was a fellow-student. There
was a Gilbertine monastery at Cambridge, and Mannyng may
have been there on business connected with his order. When
he wrote <i>Handlyng Synne</i> he had been (11. 63-76) fifteen years
in the priory, beginning to write in &ldquo;englysch rime in 1303.&rdquo;
Thirty-five years later he began his <i>Story of Inglande</i>, and had
removed (11. 139, &amp;c.) to the monastery of Sixille (now Sixhills),
near Market Rasen, in north Lincolnshire.</p>

<p><i>Handlyng Synne</i>, a poem of nearly 13,000 lines, is a free translation,
with many additions and amplifications, from William of
Waddington&rsquo;s <i>Manuel des Pechiez</i>. It is a series of metrical
homilies on the Ten Commandments, the Seven Deadly Sins
and the Seven Sacraments, illustrated by a number of amusing
stories from various sources. The <i>Cursor Mundi</i> had turned religious
history into something not very different from a romance
of chivalry, and in the stories of <i>Handlyng Synne</i> the influence
of the <i>fabliaux</i> is not far to seek. Mannyng wrote in
the English tongue not for learned but for &ldquo;lewd&rdquo; men, &ldquo;that
talys and ryme wyl blethly here,&rdquo; to occupy the leisure hours
during which they might otherwise fall into &ldquo;vylanye, dedly
synne or other folye.&rdquo; Each of his twenty-four topics has its
complement of stories. He tells of the English observance of
Saturday afternoon as holy to the Virgin, and has much to say
of popular amusements, which become sins when they keep
people away from church. Tournaments in particular are fertile
occasions of all the deadly sins; and mystery plays, except
those of the birth and resurrection of Christ performed in the
churches, also lead men into transgression. He inveighs
against the oppression of the poor by the rich, reproves those
who, weary of matins or mass, spend their time in church &ldquo;jangling,&rdquo;
telling tales, and wondering where they will get the best
ale, and revives the legend of the dancers at the church door
during mass who were cursed by the priest and went on dancing
for a twelvemonth without cessation. He loved music himself,
and justified this profane pleasure by the example of Bishop
Grosseteste, who lodged his harper in the chamber next his own;
but he holds up as a warning to gleemen the fate of the minstrel
who sang loud while the bishop said grace, and was miserably
killed by a falling stone in consequence. The old monk&rsquo;s keen
observation makes the book a far more valuable contribution
to history than his professed chronicle. It is a storehouse of
quaint stories and out-of-the-way information on manners and
customs.</p>

<p>His chronicle, <i>The Story of Inglande</i>, was also written for the
solace and amusement of the unlearned when they sit together in
fellowship (11. 6-10). The earlier half is written in octosyllabic
verse, and begins with the story of the Deluge. The genealogy
of Locrine, king of Britain, is traced back to Noah, through
Aeneas, and the chronicler relates the incidents of the Trojan
war as told by Dares the Phrygian. From this point he follows
closely the <i>Brut</i> of Wace. He loved stories for their own sake,
and found fault with Wace for questioning the miraculous
elements in the legend of Arthur. In the second half of his
chronicle, which is less simple in style, he translates from the
French of Pierre de Langtoft. He writes in rhyming alexandrines,
and in the latter part of the work uses middle rhymes.
Mannyng&rsquo;s <i>Chronicle</i> marks a change in national sentiment.
Though he regards the Norman domination as a &ldquo;bondage,&rdquo; he
is loud in his praises of Edward I., &ldquo;Edward of Inglond.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The linguistic importance of Mannyng&rsquo;s work is very great. He
used very few of those Teutonic words which, though still in use,
were eventually to drop out of the language, and he introduced
a great number of French words destined to be permanently
adopted in English. Moreover, he employed comparatively
few obsolete inflexions, and his work no doubt furthered the
adoption of the Midland dialect as the acknowledged literary
instrument. T. L. Kington-Oliphant (<i>Old and Middle English</i>,
1878) regards his work as the definite starting point of the New
English which with slight changes was to form the language of
the Book of Common Prayer.</p>

<p>A third work, usually ascribed to Mannyng, chiefly on the
ground of its existing side by side with the <i>Handlyng Synne</i>
in the Harleian and Bodleian MSS., is the <i>Medytacyuns of the
Soper of oure lorde Jhesu, And also of hys passyun And eke of the
peynes of hys swete modyr, Mayden marye</i>, a free translation of
St Bonaventura&rsquo;s <i>De coena et passione Domini...</i>.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Robert of Brunne&rsquo;s <i>Chronicle</i> exists in two MSS.: Petyt MS. 511,
written in the Northern dialect, in the Inner Temple library; and
Lambeth MS. 131 in a Midland dialect. The first part was edited
<i>The Story of England ...</i> (1887) for the Rolls Series, with an
introductory essay by F. J. Furnivall; the second part was published
by Thomas Hearne as <i>Peter Langtoft&rsquo;s Chronicle ...</i> (1725). Peter
Langtoft&rsquo;s French version was edited by Thomas Wright for the
&ldquo;Rolls Series&rdquo; in 1866. Of <i>Handlyng Synne</i> there are complete
MSS. in the Bodleian library (MS. 415) and in the British Museum
(Harleian MS. 1701), and a fragment in the library of Dulwich College
(MS. 24). It was edited, with Waddington&rsquo;s text in parallel columns,
by F. J. Furnivall for the Roxburghe Club (1862), and for the Early
English Text Society (1901-1903). The <i>Meditacyun</i> was edited from
the Bodleian and Harleian MSS. by J. Meadow Cooper for the same
society (1875). See also Gerhard Hellmers, <i>Ueber die Sprache
Robert Mannyngs of Brunne und über die Autorschaft der ihm zugeschriebenen
Meditations ...</i> (Göttingen, 1885), which contains

<p><span class="bold">MAN&OElig;UVRES, MILITARY.<a name="ar129" id="ar129"></a></span> Man&oelig;uvres may be defined
as the higher training for war of troops of all arms in large bodies,
and have been carried out in most countries ever since the first
formation of standing armies. In England no man&oelig;uvres or
camps of exercise appear to have been held till the beginning of
the 19th century, when Sir John Moore trained the famous
Light Brigade at Shorncliffe camp. In France, however, under
Louis XIV., large camps of instruction were frequently held,
the earliest recorded being that of 18,000 troops at Compiègne in
1666; and these were continued at intervals under his successor.
At these French camps much time was devoted to ceremonial,
and the man&oelig;uvres performed were of an elementary description.
Still their effect upon the training of the army for war
was far-reaching, and bore fruit in the numerous wars in the first
half of the 18th century. Moreover, experiments were made
with proposed tactical systems and technical improvements, as
in the case of the contest between <i>l&rsquo;ordre mince</i> and <i>l&rsquo;ordre
profonde</i> (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Infantry</a></span>) between 1785 and 1790. Other countries
followed suit, but it was reserved for Frederick the Great
to inaugurate a system of real man&oelig;uvres and to develop on
the training-ground the system of tactics which bore such good
fruit in his various campaigns. The numbers of troops assembled
were large; for example, at Spandau in 1753, when 36,000
men carried out man&oelig;uvres for twelve days. The king laid
the greatest stress on these exercises, and took immense pains to
turn to account the experience gained in his campaigns. Great
secrecy was observed, and before the Seven Years&rsquo; War no
stranger was allowed to be present. The result of all this careful
training was shown in the Seven Years&rsquo; War, and after it the
Prussian man&oelig;uvres gained a reputation which they have
maintained to this day. But with the passing away of the
great king they became more and more pedantic, and the fatal
results were shown in 1806. After the Napoleonic wars yearly
man&oelig;uvres became the custom in every large Continental army.
Great Britain alone thought she could dispense with them,
perhaps because of the constant practical training her troops
and officers received in the various Indian and colonial wars;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page593" id="page593"></a>593</span>
and it was not till 1853 that, by the advice of the Prince Consort,
a body of troops were gathered together for a camp of exercise
on Chobham Common, and that eventually a standing camp of
exercise was evolved out of the temporary camp formed during
the Crimean War at Aldershot.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Most continental armies have, since the great successes of the
Germans in 1870, copied more or less their system of military training;
hence it is appropriate to consider their methods first. The
whole training of the army is based on a yearly programme of gradual
progression, from the joining of the recruits in October to the training
by squads, companies, battalions and regiments, the latter finishing
their field training about the middle of August, when the man&oelig;uvre
period begins. First of all, the brigades go through five working
days of drills on flat ground, to get them under the hand of their
commanders and prepare them for man&oelig;uvres. Then follow ten
working days of man&oelig;uvres in new and varied ground, of which
four are &ldquo;brigade,&rdquo; four &ldquo;divisional&rdquo; and two &ldquo;corps&rdquo; man&oelig;uvres,
in each case the unit named being divided into two portions of all
arms, which man&oelig;uvre against one another. Each year two or
more army corps carry out man&oelig;uvres before the emperor, working
against one another. The chief feature of the German man&oelig;uvres
is the free hand allowed to leaders of sides. Of course, for reasons
of supply and transport, it is necessary to keep the troops within a
certain area, but the general and special ideas<a name="fa1s" id="fa1s" href="#ft1s"><span class="sp">1</span></a> are so framed that,
while retaining their own initiative, the leaders of sides have to give
such orders as will suit the arrangements made by the director of
man&oelig;uvres for supply. The faculty of quartering troops on private
individuals to any extent, and the fact of the troops being provided
with portable tent equipment, give great latitude to the German
leaders in their choice of quarters for troops, and so increase the
similitude of man&oelig;uvres to war. The Austrian and Italian man&oelig;uvres
are a close copy of the German, but those of the French
present the peculiarity of a certain amount of prearrangement,
especially at grand man&oelig;uvres, when it is frequently laid down
beforehand which side is to be victorious. Thus a series of pictures
of war is presented, but the man&oelig;uvres are hardly a test of the skill
of the rival leaders. But, just as in recent years in France this
practice has been modified, so also the entire liberty given to commanders
in the German man&oelig;uvres in 1906-7 had to be curtailed
in the following years owing to the strain of forced marches which
it entailed on the troops.</p>

<p>In Russia the climatic and social conditions, and the distribution
of the army, necessitate a quite peculiar system. The troops leave
their barracks and move into standing camps, generally in May, and
in these for about three months their training up to that in battalions
is carried out on the drill ground. Camps of mixed units are then
formed for a month, and from them, but always over the same
ground, the man&oelig;uvres of regiments, brigades and divisions are
performed. Then follow the so-called mobile man&oelig;uvres, which last
for ten days or a fortnight. Of all European man&oelig;uvres these are
perhaps the nearest approach to war, for the sides start a great
distance apart, and ample time is allowed for cavalry reconnaissance.
Besides, the Russian soldier does not require elaborate arrangements
for supply; hence the director is not so tied down by consideration
of this matter as in other armies. A political colour is sometimes
given to such large assemblages of troops, especially when the
man&oelig;uvres take place in frontier districts.</p>

<p>In England the military authorities have long been hampered in
the organization of man&oelig;uvres by the necessity of carrying them
out on very limited portions of government land or on areas lent as
a favour by, or hired from, private individuals. There has been no
want of recognition by the military authorities of the necessity for,
and value of, man&oelig;uvres, and the training at the camps of instruction
has been supplemented as far as possible by small man&oelig;uvres
on such portions of country as could be made available. But, with
the exception of spasmodic efforts in 1871 and 1872, it was not until
1897 that the government allowed itself to be convinced by its
military advisers, and passed a Military Man&oelig;uvres Act, by which
certain districts could be &ldquo;proclaimed&rdquo; for purposes of man&oelig;uvres,
and troops in consequence could traverse all ground. In 1898 the
first man&oelig;uvres under this Act were held in Wilts and Dorset, and
were intended to be repeated at fixed intervals in future years. In
addition, every effort was made to add to the existing permanent
training grounds for troops, and ground was acquired on Salisbury
Plain with the intention of developing it into a second Aldershot.
But the training on those well-known grounds, excellent as it is in
itself as a preparation, is not &ldquo;man&oelig;uvres,&rdquo; and never can do away
with the necessity for them, with a more or less free hand given to
the leaders over fresh country.</p>

<p>Much misconception prevails as to the nature and limitation of
the military instruction to be imparted at man&oelig;uvres. Man&oelig;uvres
are a school for the leaders, in a less degree for the led, and consequently
the minor details of instruction must be completed, and the
troops fully trained as units, before they can take part in them with
advantage. The time during which large bodies of troops can be
kept together for man&oelig;uvres is too short, and the expense too great,
to justify time being spent on exercises which might as well be carried
out in the ordinary stations or at the great training camps. Therefore
it may be laid down as a principle that man&oelig;uvres, properly
so-called, should be begun with units not smaller than a brigade of
infantry on each side, with a due proportion of the other arms
attached. It is useful if these can precede the man&oelig;uvres of larger
bodies, as the training is then progressive and the result more
satisfactory.<a name="fa2s" id="fa2s" href="#ft2s"><span class="sp">2</span></a></p>

<p>The choice of ground is of great importance. Its extent should
be proportionate to the force to be employed and the nature of the
instruction to be imparted. It should not be too hilly nor yet too
flat, but both descriptions should be judiciously combined; and
regard must be had to the water supply and the road and railway
net for the convenience of the supply service. Once the ground has
been selected, the general and special ideas must be so framed that
the troops are thereby confined to the chosen ground without seeming
to tie the hands of the leaders of sides. It is of great advantage
if the same idea can be maintained throughout each series of operations,
as thereby the interest of all concerned and the likeness to
actual warfare are increased; and, if possible, the &ldquo;state of war&rdquo;
should be continuous also. Within the limits of the special idea, the
utmost latitude should be left to leaders; but if the orders of one or
both sides seem to render a collision unlikely, the director should
so modify the special idea as to compel one or other to re-cast his
orders in such a way that contact is brought about. Such interference
will scarcely be necessary after the first issues of orders in each
series. In war the number of marching days vastly outnumbers
those of fighting, but in man&oelig;uvres this must not be allowed; tactical
instruction is what is desired, and a man&oelig;uvre day in which none
is imparted is not fully utilized. It is not necessary that all the
troops should be engaged, but at least the advanced bodies must
come into contact, and the rest must carry out marches as on active
service. Each action should be fought to its end, &ldquo;Cease firing&rdquo;
being sounded when the crisis has been reached; and on a decision
being given by the director, one side should retire and the fight be
broken off in a proper military manner. The troops should place
outposts each day, and act in all respects as if on active service.</p>

<p>The quartering and supply of troops are the chief difficulties in
the arrangement of man&oelig;uvres, and afford ample opportunity for
the practising of the officers and departments responsible for these
matters. In England, where in peace it is not possible to billet
troops on private individuals, quartering must be replaced by encampments
or bivouacs, and the selection of ground for them affords
invaluable practice. If possible, their position should be selected
to conform to the military situation; but if it is found necessary, for
reasons of water or food supply, to withdraw troops to positions
other than such as they would occupy in real warfare, time should
be allowed them on the following day to regain the positions they
would otherwise have occupied. It is next to impossible, for various
reasons, financial and other, to organize the food supply in man&oelig;uvres
as it would be in war. Sufficient transport cadres cannot
be kept up in peace, and consequently recourse must be had to hired
transport, which cannot be treated as a military body. Again, food
cannot be requisitioned, and local purchase at the time cannot be
trusted to; so dépôts of supplies must be formed beforehand in the
man&oelig;uvres area, which more or less tie the hands of the supply
service. Still, with a judicious choice of the points at which these
are formed, much may be done to approximate to service conditions,
and the more nearly these are realized the more instructive for the
supply will the man&oelig;uvres become.</p>

<p>Finally, a word must be said as to the umpire staff, which represents
the bullets. The most careful selection of officers for this
important duty is necessary, and they must have sufficient authority
and be in sufficient number to make their influence everywhere
felt. Their principal object should be to come to a decision quickly,
so as to prevent the occurrence of unreal situations; and by constant
intercommunication they must ensure uniformity in their decisions,
and so maintain continuity of the action all over the man&oelig;uvres
battlefield.</p>

an instrument for measuring the pressures exerted by gases or
vapours. An alternative name is pressure gauge, but this
term may conveniently be restricted to manometers used in
connexion with steam-boilers, &amp;c. The principle of hydrostatics
suggest the most common forms. Suppose we have a <b>U</b>
tube (fig. 1), containing a liquid: if the pressures on the surfaces
of the liquid be equal, then the surfaces will be at the same
height. If, on the other hand, the pressure in one limb be
greater than the pressure in the other, the surfaces will be at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page594" id="page594"></a>594</span>
different heights, the difference being directly proportional to
the difference of pressures and inversely as the specific gravity
of the liquid used.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Two forms are in use: (1) the &ldquo;open-tube,&rdquo; in which the pressure
in one limb is equal to the atmospheric pressure, and (2) the &ldquo;closed-tube,&rdquo;
in which the experimental pressure is balanced against the
liquid column and the air compressed into the upper part of a closed
limb of the tube. In the &ldquo;open tube&rdquo; form (fig. 1) the pressure on
the surface <i>a</i> is equal to the pressure on the surface at b (one atmosphere)
plus the hydrostatic pressure exerted by the liquid column
of height a b. The liquid commonly used is mercury. If a scale
be placed behind the limbs of the tube, so that the difference a b can
be directly determined, then the pressure in <i>a</i> is at once expressible
as P + <i>a b</i> in millimetres or inches of mercury, where P is the atmospheric
pressure, known from an ordinary barometric observation.
In the &ldquo;closed tube&rdquo; form (fig. 2) the calculation is not so simple,
for the variation of pressure on the mercury surface in the closed
limb has to be taken into account. Suppose the length of the air
column in the closed limb be <i>h</i> when the mercury is at the same
height in both tubes. Applying the experimental pressure to
the open end, if this be greater than atmospheric pressure the
mercury column will rise and the air column diminish in the closed
limb. Let the length of the air column be <i>h</i>&prime;, then its pressure is <i>h</i>/<i>h</i>&prime;
atmospheres. The difference in height of the mercury columns in
the two limbs is 2(<i>h</i> &minus; <i>h</i>&prime;), and the pressure in the open limb is obviously
equal to that of a column of mercury of length 2(<i>h</i> &minus; <i>h</i>&prime;), plus  <i>h</i>/<i>h</i>&prime;
atmospheres. These instruments are equally serviceable for determining
pressures less than one atmosphere. In laboratory practice,
<i>e.g.</i> when it is required to determine the degree of exhaust of a water
pump, a common form consists of a vertical glass tube having its
lower end immersed in a basin of mercury, and its upper end connected
by means of an intermediate vessel to the exhaust. The
mercury rises in the tube, and the difference between the barometric
height and the length of the mercury column gives the pressure
attained.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MANOR.<a name="ar131" id="ar131"></a></span> Any definition of a manor, in land tenure, must
take note of two elements&mdash;economic and political. The
manor has an estate for its basis, although it need not coincide
with an estate, but may be wider. It is also a political unit, a
district formed for purposes of government, although the political
functions made over to it may greatly vary. As a lordship
based on land tenure, the manor necessarily comprises a ruler
and a population dependent on him, and the characteristic trait
of such dependence consists not in ownership extending over
persons, as in slave-holding communities, nor in contractual
arrangements, as in a modern economic organization, but in
various forms and degrees of subjection, chiefly regulated by
custom. In the sense mentioned the manor is by no means a
peculiarly English institution; it occurs in every country where
feudalism got a hold. Under other names we find it not only
in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, but also, to a certain extent,
in the Byzantine Empire, Russia, Japan, &amp;c. It is especially
representative of an aristocratic stage in the development of
European nations. When tribal notions and arrangements
ceased to be sufficient for upholding their commonwealths,
when social and political life had to be built up on the basis of
land-tenure, the type of manorial organization came forward in
natural course. It was closely connected with natural economy,
and was suited to a narrow horizon of economic wants and political
requirements. At the same time it provided links for a kind
of national federation of military estates. We shall only speak
of the course of manorial evolution in France and Germany,
because this presents the clearest expression of the fundamental
principles of manorial life and the best material for comparison
with English facts.</p>

<p>One problem common to the entire European world has to be
considered from the very beginning. Does the manor date
from the Roman Empire, or not? Can its chief features be
traced in Roman institutions? There can be no doubt that at
the end of the Roman period certain traits are noticeable which
might, under favourable conditions, develop into a manorial
combination. Great estates with political functions, populations
subjected to the political lordship of landowners, appear in the
closing centuries of the empire, and have to be reckoned with as
precursors of medieval manorial life. The original organization
of the ancient world was built up on the self-government of cities
and on the sharp distinction between citizens and slaves. Both
features were gradually modified by the Roman Empire. Self-government
was atrophied by bureaucratic interference; the
economy based on the exploitation of slaves began to give way
before relations in which the elements of freedom and serfdom
were oddly mixed. During the last centuries of its existence
the Western Empire became more and more a conglomerate of
barbaric and half-civilized populations, and it is not strange
that the characteristic germs of feudalism began to show themselves
within its territory as well as outside it. As far as
political institutions are concerned, we notice that the central
power, after claiming an absolute sway over its subjects, is
obliged more and more to lean on private forces in order to
maintain itself. One of its favourite resources in the 4th and
5th centuries consists in making great landowners responsible
for the good behaviour of their tenants and even of their less
important neighbours. The <i>saltus</i>, the great domain, is occasionally
recognized as a separate district exempt from the ordinary
administration of the city, subordinated to its owner in respect
of taxes and police. Even in ordinary estates (<i>fundi</i>) there is a
tendency to make the landowner responsible for military conscription,
for the presentation of criminals to justice. On the
other hand the incumbents of ecclesiastical offices are nominated
in accordance with the wishes of patrons among the landowners;
in the administration of justice the influence of this same class
makes itself felt more and more. Nor are signs of a convergent
evolution wanting on the economic side. Slaves are used more
and more as small householders provided with rural tenements
and burdened with rents and services. Free peasant farmers
holding by free agreement get more and more reduced to a status
of half-free settlers occupying their tenancies on the strength
of custom and traditional ascription to the glebe. Eventually
this status is recognized as a distinct class by imperial legislation.
Ominous symptoms of growing political disruption and of an
aristocratic transformation of society were visible everywhere at
the close of the empire. Yet there could be no talk of a manorial
system as long as the empire and the commercial intercourse
protected by it continued to exist.</p>

<p>The fall of the empire hastened the course of evolution. It
brought into prominence barbaric tribes who were unable to
uphold either the political power or the economic system of the
Romans. The Germans had from old certain manorial features
in the constitution of their government and husbandry. The
owner of a house had always been possessed of a certain political
power within its precincts, as well as within the fenced area surrounding
it: the peace of the dwelling and the peace of the hedged-in
yard were recognized by the legal customs of all the German
tribes. The aristocratic superiority of warriors over all classes
engaged in base peaceful work was also deeply engraved in the
minds of the fighting and conquering tribes. On the other hand
the downfall of complicated forms of civilization and civil intercourse
rendered necessary a kind of subjection in which tributary
labourers were left to a certain extent to manage their own affairs.
The Germanic conqueror was unable to move slaves about like
draughts: he had no scope for a complicated administration of
capital and work. The natural outcome was to have recourse
to serfdom with its convenient system of tribute and services.</p>

<p>But, as in the case of the Roman Empire, the formation of
regular manors was held back for a time in the early Germanic
monarchies by the lingering influence of tribal organization.
In the second period of medieval development in continental
Europe, in the Carolingian epoch, the features of the estate as
a political unit are more sharply marked. Notwithstanding
the immense efforts of Charles Martel, Pippin and Charlemagne
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page595" id="page595"></a>595</span>
to strengthen the tottering edifice of the Frankish Empire,
public authority had to compromise with aristocratic forces
in order to ensure regular government. As regards military
organization this is expressed in the recognition of the power
of <i>seniores</i>, called upon to lead their vassals in the host; as regards
jurisdiction, in the increase of the numbers of commended
freemen who seek to interpose the powerful patronage of lay
and secular magnates between themselves and the Crown.
Great estates arose not only on the lands belonging to the king,
but on that of churches and of lay potentates, and the constitution
of these estates, as described for instance in the
Polyptique of St Germain des Près or in the &ldquo;Brevium
exempla ad describendas res ecclesiasticas et fiscales&rdquo; (<i>Capitularia</i>,
ed. Boretius, i. 250), reminds us forcibly of that of
later feudal estates. They contain a home-farm, with a court
and a <i>casa indominicata</i>, or manor-house, some holdings (<i>mansi</i>)
of free men (<i>ingenuiles</i>), of serfs (<i>serviles</i>), and perhaps of half-free
people (<i>lidiles</i>). The rents and services of this dependent
population are stated in detail, as in later custumals, and there
is information about the agricultural implements, the stores and
stock on the home-farm. Thus the economic basis of the manor
exists in more or less complete order, but it cannot be said as
yet to form the prevailing type of land tenure in the country.
Holdings of independent free men and village organizations of
ancient type still surround the great estates, and in the case of
ecclesiastical possessions we are often in a position to watch
their gradual extension at the expense of the neighbouring
free settlers, by way of direct encroachment, and by that of
surrender and commendation on the part of the weaker citizens.
Another factor which plays a great part in the gradual process
of infeudation is the rise of private jurisdictions, which falls
chiefly into the 10th and 11th centuries. The struggle against
Northmen, Magyars and Slavs gave a crowning touch to the
process of localization of political life and of the aristocratic
constitution of society.</p>

<p>In order to describe the full-grown continental manor of the
11th century it is better to take French examples than German,
Italian or Spanish. Feudalism in France attained the greatest
extension and utmost regularity, while in other European
countries it was hampered and intermixed with other institutional
features. The expression best corresponding to the
English &ldquo;manor,&rdquo; in the sense of an organized district, was
<i>seigneurie</i>. <i>Manoir</i> is in use, and is, of course, a French word
corresponding to <i>manerium</i>, but it meant strictly &ldquo;mansion&rdquo;
or chief homestead in France. <i>Baronie</i> is another term which
might be employed in some instances as an equivalent of the
English manor, but, in a sense, it designates only one species
of a larger genus, the estate of a full baron in contrast to a mere
knight&rsquo;s fee, as well as to a principality. Some of the attributes
of a baron are, however, typical, as the purest expression of
manorial rights, and may be used in a general characterization
of the latter.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The <i>seigneurie</i> may be considered from three points of view&mdash;as
a unit of administration, as an economic unit, and as a union of
social classes.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) In principle the disruption of political life brought about by
feudalism ought to have resulted in the complete administrative
independence of the manor. <i>Chaque baron est souverain dans sa
baronie</i> is a proverb meant to express this radical view of manorial
separatism. As a matter of fact this separatism was never completely
realized, and even at the time of the greatest prevalence of
feudalism the little sovereigns of France were combined into a loose
federation of independent fiefs. Still, the proverb was not a mere
play of words, and it took a long time for the kings of France to break
in potentates, like the little Sire de Coucy in the immediate vicinity
of Paris, who sported in his crest the self-complacent motto: <i>Je ne
suis ni comte, ni marquis, je suis le sire de Coucy</i>. The institutional
expression of this aspect of feudalism in the life of the <i>seigneurie</i> was
the jurisdiction combined with the latter. The principal origin of
this jurisdiction was the dismemberment of royal justice, the acquisition
by certain landowners of the right of holding royal pleas. The
assumption of authority over public tribunals of any kind was
naturally considered as equivalent to such a transmission of royal
right. But other sources may be noticed also. It was assumed by
French feudal law that in all cases when land was granted by a
<i>seigneur</i> in subinfeudation the recipients would be bound to appear
as members of a court of tenants for the settlement of conflicts in
regard to land. A third source may be traced in the extension of
the patrimonial justice of a person over his serfs and personal
dependents to the classes of free and half-free population connected
with the <i>seigneurie</i> in one way or another. There arose in consequence
of these assumptions of jurisdiction a most bewildering confusion
of tribunals and judicial rights. It happened sometimes that
the question as to who should be the judge in some particular contest
was decided by matter-of-fact seizure&mdash;the holder of pleas who was
the first on the spot to proclaim himself judge in a case was deemed
entitled to jurisdiction. In other cases one <i>seigneur</i> held the pleas
in a certain place for six days in the week, while some competitor
of his possessed jurisdiction during the seventh. A certain order
was brought into this feudal chaos by the classification of judiciary
functions according to the four categories of high, middle, low and
tenurial justice. The scope of the first three subdivisions is sufficiently
explained by their names; the fourth concerned cases arising
from subinfeudation. As a rule the baron or <i>seigneur</i> sat in justice
with a court of assessors or peers, but the constitution of such courts
varied a great deal. They represented partly the succession of the
old popular courts with their <i>scabini</i>, partly courts of vassals and
tenants. In strict feudal law an appeal was allowed from a lower to a
higher court only in a case of a denial of justice (<i>dénie de justice</i>),
not in error or revision of sentence. This rule was, however, very
often infringed, and gave way ultimately before the restoration of
royal justice.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The economic fabric of the French <i>seigneurie</i> varied greatly,
according to localities. In the north of France it was not unlike
that of the English manor. The capital messuage, or castle, and the
home-farm of the lord, were surrounded by dependent holdings,
<i>censives</i>, paying rent, and villein tenements burdened with services.
Between these tenancies there were various ties of neighbourhood
and economic solidarity recalling the open-field cultivation in England
and Germany. When the harvest was removed from the open
strips they returned to a state of undivided pasture in which the
householders of the village exercised rights of common with their
cattle. Wild pasture and woods were used more or less in the same
fashion as in England (<i>droit de pacage de vaine pâture</i>). The inhabitants
often formed courts and held meetings in order to settle the by-laws,
and to adjudicate as to trespasses and encroachments (<i>courts
colongères</i>). In the south, individual property was more prevalent
and the villagers were not so closely united by ties of neighbourhood.
Yet even there the dependent households were arranged into <i>mansi</i>
or <i>colonicae</i>, subjected to approximately equal impositions in respect
of rents and services. In any case the characteristic dualism of
manorial life, the combined working of a central home-farm, and of
its economic satellites providing necessary help in the way of services,
and contributing towards the formation of manorial stores, is quite
as much a feature of French as of English medieval husbandry.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The social relations between the manorial lord and his subjects
are marked by various forms of the exploitation of the latter by the
former. Apart from jurisdictional profits, rents and agricultural
services, dues of all kinds are exacted from the rural population.
Some of these dues have to be traced to servile origins, although they
were evidently gradually extended to groups of people who were
not descended from downright serfs but had lapsed into a state of
considerable subjection. The <i>main morte</i> of rustic tenants meant
that they had no goods of their own, but held movable property
on sufferance without the right of passing it on to their successors.
As a matter of fact, sons were admitted to inheritance after their
fathers, and sometimes succession was extended to other relatives,
but the person taking inheritance paid a heavy fine for entering
into possession, or gave up a horse, an ox, or some other especially
valuable piece of property. The <i>formariage</i> corresponded to the
English <i>merchetum</i>, and was exacted from rustics on the marriage
of their daughters. Although this payment assumed very different
shapes, and sometimes only appeared in case consorts belonged to
different lords, it was considered a badge of serfdom. <i>Chevage</i>
(<i>capitagium</i>) might be exacted as a poll-tax from all the unfree
inhabitants of a <i>seigneurie</i>, or, more especially, from those who left
it to look for sustenance abroad. The power of the lord as a landowner
was more particularly expressed in his right of pre-emption
(<i>retrait seigneurial</i>), and in taxes on alienation (<i>lods et ventes</i>). As a
person wielding political authority, a kind of sovereignty, the lord
enjoyed divers rights which are commonly attributed to the state&mdash;the
right of coining money, of levying direct taxes and toll (<i>tallagium,
tolneta</i>) and of instituting monopolies. These latter were of common
occurrence, and might take the shape, for instance, of forcing the
inhabitants to make use of the lord&rsquo;s mill (<i>moulin banal</i>), or of his
oven (<i>four banal</i>), or of his bull (<i>taureau banal</i>).</p>

<p>In Germany the history of the manorial system is bound up
with the evolution of the <i>Grundherrschaft</i> (landlordship) as
opposed to <i>Gutsherrschaft</i> (estate-ownership). The latter need
not include any elements of public authority and aristocratic
supremacy: the former is necessarily connected with public
functions and aristocratic standing. The centre of the <i>Grundherrschaft</i>
was the <i>Hof</i>, the court or hall of the lord, from
which the political and economic rights of the lord radiated.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page596" id="page596"></a>596</span>
The struggle of the military aristocracy and of ecclesiastical
institutions with common freedom was more protracted than in
France or England; the lordships very often took the shape of
disparate rights over holdings and groups of population scattered
over wide tracts of country and intermixed with estates and
inhabitants subjected to entirely different authority. Therefore
the aspect of German manorialism is more confused and heterogeneous
than that of the French or English systems. One
remarkable feature of it is the consistent separation of criminal
justice from other kinds of jurisdiction on Church property.
Episcopal sees and abbeys delegated their share of criminal
justice to lay magnates in the neighbourhood (<i>Vogtei</i>), and this
division of power became a source of various conflicts and of many
entangled relations. The main lines of German manorialism
are not radically different from those of France and England.
The communal element, the <i>Dorfverband</i>, is usually more strongly
developed than in France, and assumes a form more akin to
the English township. But there were regions, <i>e.g.</i> Westphalia,
where the population had settled in separate farms (<i>Hofsystem</i>),
and where the communal solidarity was reduced to a union for
administrative purposes and for the use of pasture.</p>

<p>It need hardly be added that every step in the direction of
more active economic intercourse and more efficient public
authority tended to lessen the influence of the manorial system
in so far as the latter was based on the localization of government,
natural husbandry and aristocratic authority.</p>

<p><i>The Manor in England.</i>&mdash;It will be most convenient to describe
a typical English manor in its best known period, the 13th
century, and to indicate briefly the modifications of the type
which varying conditions may produce. Topographically such a
manor consisted partly of the houses of the inhabitants more or
less closely clustered together, and surrounded by arable land
divided into large fields, two or three in number. Each of these
fields was divided again into shots or furlongs, and each of the
shots was broken up into cultivated strips a pole wide, each
containing an acre, separated by narrow balks of turf. There
were also certain meadows for supplying hay; and beyond the
cultivated land lay the wood and waste of the manor. Portions
of arable or meadow land might be found apart from the organization
of the remainder; the lord of the manor might have a
park, and each householder a garden, but the land of the manor
was the open fields, the meadows and the wastes or common.
The condition of the inhabitants of such a manor is as complex
as its geography. At the head of the society came the lord of
<span class="sidenote">Rights of Lord and Tenants.</span>
the manor, with his hall, court, or manor-house,
and the land immediately about it, and his demesne
both in the fields and in the meadow land. The
arable demesne consisted of certain of the acre strips
lying scattered over the various furlongs; his meadow was a portion
assigned to him each year by the custom of the manor. He
had also rights over the surrounding waste paramount to those
enjoyed by the other inhabitants. Part of his demesne land
would be granted out to free tenants to hold at a rent or by
military or other service; part would be in the lord&rsquo;s own hands,
and cultivated by him. Each part so granted out will carry with
it a share in the meadow land and in the profits of the waste.
These rights of the free tenants over the waste limited the lord&rsquo;s
power over it. He could not by enclosure diminish their interest
in it. The statute of Merton in 1236 and the second statute
of Westminster in 1285 marked the utmost limit of enclosure
allowed in the 13th century. Below the lord and the free tenants
came the villeins, natives, bondmen, or holders of virgates
or yard-lands, each holding a house, a fixed number of acre
strips, a share of the meadow and of the profits of the waste.
The number of strips so held was usually about thirty; but virgates
of fifteen acres or even eighty are not unknown. In any
one manor, however, the holdings of all the villeins were equal.
<span class="sidenote">Rights of Villeins.</span>
Normally the holder of a virgate was unfree; he had
no rights in the eye of the law against his lord, who
was protected from all suits by the <i>exceptio villenagii</i>;
he could not without leave quit the manor, and could be reclaimed
by process of law if he did; the strict contention of law
deprived him of all right to hold property; and in many cases
he was subject to certain degrading incidents, such as <i>merchet</i>
(<i>merchetum</i>), a payment due to the lord upon the marriage of a
daughter, which was regarded as a special mark of unfree condition.
But there are certain limitations to be made. Firstly,
all these incidents of tenure, even merchet, might not affect
the personal status of the tenant; he might still be free, though
holding by an unfree tenure; secondly, even if unfree, he was
not exposed to the arbitrary will of his lord but was protected
by the custom of the manor as interpreted by the manor court.
Moreover, he was not a slave, he was not bought and sold apart
from his holding. The hardship of his condition lay in the
services due from him. As a rule a villein paid for his holding
in money, in labour and in kind. In money he paid, firstly, a
small fixed rent called rent of assize; and, secondly, dues under
various names, partly in lieu of services commuted into money
payments, and partly for the privileges and profits enjoyed by
him on the waste of the manor. In labour he paid more heavily.
Week by week he had to come with his own plough and oxen to
plough the lord&rsquo;s demesne; when ploughing was done he had to
harrow, to reap the crops, to thresh and carry them, or do whatever
might be required of him, until his allotted number of days
labour in the year was done. Beyond this his lord might
request of him extra days in harvest or other seasons of emergency,
and these requests could not be denied. Further, all the
carriage of the manor was provided by the villeins, even to places
as much as a hundred miles away from the manor. The mending
of the ploughs, hedging, ditching, sheepshearing and other
miscellaneous work also fell upon him, and it is sometimes hard
to see what time remained to him to work upon his own holding.
In kind he usually rendered honey, eggs, chickens and perhaps a
ploughshare, but these payments were almost always small in
value. Another class of inhabitants remains to be mentioned&mdash;the
<span class="sidenote">Cotters.</span>
cotters. These are the poor of the manor,
who hold a cottage and garden, or perhaps one acre
or half an acre in the fields. They were unfree in condition,
and in most manors their services were modelled upon those of
the villeins. From their ranks were usually drawn the shepherd
of the manor, the bee-keeper and other minor officials of the
manor.</p>

<p>A complicated organization necessarily involves administrators.
Just as the services of the tenants and even their names
vary from manor to manor, so does the nature of the staff.
Highest in rank came the steward; he was attached to no manor
in particular, but controlled a group, travelling from one to
another to take accounts, to hold the courts, and generally
<span class="sidenote">Staff.</span>
represent the lord. Under him are the officers of
the several manors. First came the bailiff or beadle,
the representative of the lord in the manor; his duty was to
collect the rents and services, to gather in the lord&rsquo;s crops and
account for the receipts and expenditure of the manor. Closely
connected with him was the &ldquo;messor&rdquo; or reaper; in many cases,
indeed, &ldquo;reaper&rdquo; seems to have been only another name for
the bailiff. But the villeins were not without their own officer,
the provost or reeve. His duty was to arrange the distribution
of the services due from the tenants, and, as their representative,
to assist the bailiff in the management of the manor. Sometimes
the same man appears to have united both offices, and we find
the reeve accounting to the lord for the issues of the manor.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page597" id="page597"></a>597</span>
To these important officials may be added a number of smaller
ones, the shepherd, the swineherd, the bee-keeper, the cowherd,
the ploughman and so on, mostly selected from the cotters, and
occupying their small holdings by the services expressed in
their titles. The number varies with the constitution and needs
of each estate, and they are often replaced by hired labour.</p>

<p>The most complicated structure in the system is the manor
court. The complication is, indeed, partly the work of lawyers
interpreting institutions they did not understand by
formulae not adapted to describe them. But beyond
<span class="sidenote">Manor Court.</span>
this there remain the facts that the court was
the meeting-point of the lord and the tenants both free and unfree,
that any question touching on the power and constitution
of the court was bound to affect the interests of the lord and the
tenants, and that there was no external power capable of settling
such questions as did arise. Amid this maze a few clear lines
can be laid down. In the first place, so far as the 13th century
goes, all the discussion that has collected about the terms
court leet, court baron and court customary may be put aside;
it relates to questions which in the 13th century were only just
emerging. The manor court at that date exercised its criminal,
civil, or manorial jurisdiction as one court; its names may differ,
the parties before it may be free or unfree, but the court is the
same. Its president was the lord&rsquo;s steward; the bailiff was the
lord&rsquo;s representative and the public prosecutor; and the tenants
of the manor, both free and unfree, attended at the court and
gave judgment in the cases brought before it. To modern ears
the constitution sounds unfamiliar. The president of the court
settled the procedure of the court, carried it out, and gave the
final sentence, but over the law of the court he had no power.
All that is comprised in the word &ldquo;judgment&rdquo; was settled by the
body of tenants present at the court. This attendance was,
indeed, compulsory, and absence subjected to a fine any tenant
owing and refusing the service known as &ldquo;suit of court.&rdquo; It
may be asked who in these courts settled questions of fact.
The answer must be that disputed questions of fact could only
be settled in one way, by ordeal; and that in most manorial
courts the method employed was the wager of law. The business
of the court may be divided into criminal, manorial and civil.
Its powers under the first head depended on the franchises
enjoyed by the lord in the particular manor; for the most
part only petty offences were triable, such as small thefts,
breaches of the assize of bread and ale, assaults, and the like;
except under special conditions, the justice of great offences
remained in the king. But offences against the custom of the
manor, such as bad ploughing, improper taking of wood from
the lord&rsquo;s woods, and the like, were of course the staple criminal
business of the court. Under the head of manorial business the
court dealt with the choice of the manorial officers, and had some
power of making regulations for the management of the manor;
but its most important function was the recording of the surrenders
and admittances of the villein tenants. Into the history
and meaning of this form of land transfer it is not necessary to
enter here. But it must be noted that the conveyance of a
villein&rsquo;s holding was effected by the vendor surrendering his
land to the lord, who thereupon admitted the purchaser to the
holding. The same procedure was employed in all cases of
transfer of land, and the transaction was regularly recorded
upon the rolls of the court among the records of all the other
business transacted there. Finally, the court dealt with all
suits as to land within the manor, questions of dower and inheritance,
and with civil suits not connected with land. But it need
hardly be said that in an ordinary rural manor very few of these
would occur.</p>

<p>It will be clear on consideration that the manor court as here
described consisted of conflicting elements of very different
origin and history. Founded partly on express grants of franchises,
partly on the inherent right of a feudal lord to hold a court
for his free tenants, partly on the obscure community traceable
among the unfree inhabitants of the manor, it is incapable of
strict legal definition. All these elements, moreover, contain
in themselves reasons for the decay which gradually came over
the system. The history of the decay of the manorial jurisdictions
in England has not yet been written. On the one hand
were the king&rsquo;s courts, with new and improved processes of law;
on the other hand the gradual disintegration which marks the
history of the manor during the 14th and 15th centuries. The
criminal jurisdiction was the first to disappear, and was closely
followed by the civil jurisdiction over the free tenants; and in
modern times all that is left is the jurisdiction over the customary
tenants and their holdings, and that in an attenuated form.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>A few words must be given to the legal theories of the 15th century
on the manor court. It would seem to have become the law that to
the existence of the manor two courts were necessary&mdash;a court
customary for customary tenants, and a court baron for free tenants.
In the court customary the lord&rsquo;s steward is the judge; in the court
baron the freeholders are the judges. If the freeholders in the manor
diminish to less than two in number the court baron cannot be held,
and the manor perishes. Nor can it be revived by the grant of new
freehold tenures, because under the statute of <i>Quia Emptores</i> such
new freeholders would hold not of the lord of the manor, but of his
lord. The customary tenants and the court customary may survive,
but the manor is only a reputed manor. Of the 13th century all
this is untrue, but even at that date the existence of free tenants was
in a measure essential to the existence of the manor court. If there
were none the jurisdiction of the court over free tenants of course
collapsed; but in addition to this the lord also lost his power of exercising
the highest criminal franchises, even if he otherwise possessed
them; he could, for instance, no longer hang a murderer on his own
gallows. Perhaps it may be said that to the exercise of the feudal
power and of the royal franchises the presence of free tenants was
necessary. But it is clear that no such condition was necessary to
the existence of the manor.</p>

<p>Apart from the change in the court of the manor, the most important
thread in its history is the process which converted the villein
into the copyholder. Here again the subject is imperfectly explored,
and part of it is still subject to controversy. In the strict view of
contemporary lawyers the holding of the villein tenant of the 13th
century was at the will of the lord, and the king&rsquo;s courts of law would
not protect him in his possession. If, however, the villein were a
tenant on the king&rsquo;s ancient demesne his condition was improved.
The writs of <i>monstraverunt</i> and the little writ of right close protected
him from the improper exaction of services and from ejection by the
lord. But in ordinary manors there was no such immunity. That
ejection was common cannot be believed, but it was legally possible;
and it was not until the well-known decision of Danby, C. J., and
Bryan, C. J., in 7 Edw. IV., that the courts of law would entertain
an action of trespass brought against his lord by a customary tenant.
From that date the courts, both of law and equity, begin to intervene;
and the records of the Courts of Star Chamber and Requests show
that in the Tudor period equitable suits brought by tenants against
their lords are not infrequent. Side by side with the alteration in
the legal condition of the manor there went on an economic change.
The labour rents and other services slowly disappeared, and were
replaced by money payments. The field divisions gave way before
inclosures, effected sometimes by the lords and sometimes by the
tenants. Change in legal and agricultural practice went on side by
side, and finally the manor ceased to be an important social form,
and became only a peculiar form of land tenure and the abode of
antiquarian curiosities.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MANOR-HOUSE<a name="ar132" id="ar132"></a></span> (Lat. <i>manerium</i>; Fr. <i>manoir</i>), in architecture,
the name given to the dwelling-house of the lord of the manor.
The manor-house was generally arranged for defence against
robbers and thieves and was often surrounded by a moat with
drawbridge, but was not provided with a keep or with towers
or lofty curtain walls so as to stand a siege. The early buildings
were comparatively small, square in plan, comprising a hall
with one or two adjacent chambers; at a later period wings
were added, thus forming three sides of a quadrangle, like the
house designed by John Thorpe as his residence, the plan of
which is among his drawings in the Soane Museum. One of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page598" id="page598"></a>598</span>
the most ancient examples is the manor-house built by Richard
C&oelig;ur de Lion at Southampton as a rendezvous when he was
about to cross into France. This consisted of a hall and chapel
on the first floor, with cellars on the ground floor; the walls of
this structure, with the chimney-piece, are still in existence.
The distinction between the &ldquo;manor-house&rdquo; and &ldquo;castle&rdquo;
is not always very clearly defined; in France such buildings as
the castles of Aydon (Northumberland) and of Stokesay (Shropshire)
would be regarded as manor-houses in that they were
built as country houses and not as fortresses, like Coucy and
Pierrefonds; some of the smaller castles in France were, in the
16th century, transformed into manor-houses by the introduction
of windows on the second floors of their towers and the partial
destruction of their curtain walls, as in the manor-houses of
Sedières (Corrèze), Nantouillet and Compiègne; and in the same
century, as at Chenonceaux, Blois and Chambord, though angle
towers and machicolated parapets still formed part of the design,
they were considered to be purely decorative features. The
same is found in England; thus in Thornbury and Hurstmonceaux
castles, and in Cowdray House, the fortifications were more for
show than for use. There is an interesting example of a French
manor-house near Dieppe, known as the Manoir-d&rsquo;Ango, built
in 1525, of which a great portion still exists, where the proprietor
Ango received François I., so that it must have been of considerable
size.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>In England the principal examples of which remains exist are the
manor-houses of Appleton, Berkshire, with a moat; King John&rsquo;s
house at Warnford (Hampshire); Boothby Ragnell, Lincolnshire,
with traces of moat; Godmersham, Kent; Little Wenham Hall,
Suffolk, built partly in brick and flint, and one of the earliest in which
the bricks, probably imported from Flanders, are found; Charney
Hall, Berkshire (T-shaped in plan in two storeys); Longthorpe
House, near Peterborough; Stokesay, Shropshire, already referred
to; Cottesford, Oxfordshire; Woodcraft, Northamptonshire; Acton
Burnell, Shropshire; Old Soar, Plaxtol, Kent, in two storeys, the
ground storey vaulted and used as cellar and storehouse, and the
upper floor with hall, solar and chapel. The foundation of all these
dates from the 13th century. Ightham Mote, Kent, portions of
which, with the moat, date from the 14th century, is one of the
best preserved manor-houses; then follow Norborough Hall, Northamptonshire;
Creslow manor-house, Bucks, with moat; Sutton
Courtenay, Berkshire; the Court Lodge, Great Chart, Kent; Stanton
St Quentin, Great Chalfield, and South Wraxhall, all in Wilts;
Meare manor-house, Somerset; Ockwell, Berks; Kingfield manor-house,
Derbyshire; Kirby Muxloe, Leicestershire; Stoke Albany,
Northamptonshire; and, in the 16th century, Large Marney Hall,
Essex (1520); Sutton Place, Surrey (1530); the Vyne, Hampshire,
already influenced by the first Renaissance. In the 17th and 18th
centuries the manor-house is generally rectangular in plan, and,
though well and solidly built, would seem to have been erected more
with a view to internal comfort than to exterior embellishments.
There is one other type of manor-house, which partakes of the
character of the castle in its design, and takes the form of a tower,
rectangular or square, with angle turrets and in several storeys;
in France it is represented by the manor-houses of St Medard
near Bordeaux and Camarsae (Dordogne), and in England by
Tattershall Castle, Lincolnshire and Middleton Tower, Norfolk,
both being in brick.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MANRESA,<a name="ar133" id="ar133"></a></span> a town of north-eastern Spain, in the province of
Barcelona, on the river Cardoner and the Barcelona-Lérida
railway. Pop. (1900), 23,252. Manresa is the chief town of
the highlands watered by the Cardoner and upper Llobregat,
which meet below the town, and are also connected by a canal
18 m. long. Two bridges, one built of stone and dating from
the Roman period, the other constructed of iron in 1804, unite
the older and larger part of Manresa with the modern suburbs on
the right bank of the river. The principal buildings are the collegiate
church of Santa Maria de la Séo, the Dominican monastery,
and the church of San Ignazio, built over the cavern (<i>cueva
santa</i>) where Ignatius de Loyola spent most of the year 1522 in
penitentiary exercises and the composition of his <i>Exercitia
spiritualia</i>. Santa Maria is a fine example of Spanish Gothic,
and consists, like many Catalan churches, of nave and chancel,
aisles and ambulatory, without transepts. One of its chief
treasures is an exquisite 15th-century Florentine altar-frontal,
preserved in the sacristy. The Dominican monastery, adjoining
the <i>cueva santa</i>, commands a magnificent view of the Montserrat
(<i>q.v.</i>), and is used for the accommodation of the pilgrims who
yearly visit the cavern in thousands. Manresa has important
iron-foundries and manufactures of woollen, cotton and linen
goods, ribbons, hats, paper, soap, chemicals, spirits and flour.
Building-stone is quarried near the town.</p>

<p>Manresa is probably the <i>Munorisa</i> of the Romans, which was
the capital of the Jacetani or Jaccetani, an important tribe of
the south-eastern Pyrenees. A large portion of the town was
burned by the French in 1811.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MANRIQUE, GÓMEZ<a name="ar134" id="ar134"></a></span> (1412?-1490?), Spanish poet, soldier,
politician and dramatist, was born at Amusco. The fifth son
of Pedro Manrique, <i>adelantado mayor</i> of León, and nephew of
Santillana (<i>q.v.</i>), Gómez Manrique was introduced into public
life at an early age, took a prominent part against the constable
Álvaro de Luna during the reign of John II., went into opposition
against Miguel Lucas de Iranzo in the reign of Henry IV., and
declared in favour of the infanta Isabel, whose marriage with
Ferdinand he promoted. Besides being a distinguished soldier,
he acted as a moderating political influence and, when appointed
<i>corregidor</i> of Toledo, was active in protecting the converted
Jews from popular resentment. His will was signed on the 31st
of May 1490, and he is known to have died before the 16th of
February 1491. He inherited the literary taste of his uncle
Santillana, and was greatly esteemed in his own age; but his
reputation was afterwards eclipsed by that of his nephew Jorge
Manrique (<i>q.v.</i>), whose <i>Coplas</i> were continually reproduced.
Gómez Manrique&rsquo;s poems were not printed till 1885, when they
were edited by Antonio Paz y Melia. They at once revealed
him to be a poet of eminent merit, and it seems certain that
his <i>Consejos</i>, addressed to Diego Arias de Avila, inspired the
more famous <i>Coplas</i> of his nephew. His didactic verses are
modelled upon those of Santillana, and his satires are somewhat
coarse in thought and expression; but his place in the history
of Spanish literature is secure as the earliest Spanish dramatist
whose name has reached posterity. He wrote the <i>Representación
del nascimiento de Nuestro Señor</i>, a play on the Passion, and
two <i>momos</i>, or interludes, played at court.</p>

skirmish near the fortress of Garci-Muñoz in 1478, and was
buried in the church attached to the convent of Uclés. His
love-songs, satires, and acrostic verses are merely ingenious
compositions in the taste of his age; he owes his imperishable
renown to a single poem, the <i>Coplas por la muerte de su padre</i>,
an elegy of forty stanzas on the death of his father, which was
apparently first printed in the <i>Cancionero llamado de Fray
Inigo de Mendoza</i> about the year 1482. There is no foundation
for the theory that Manrique drew his inspiration from an Arabic
poem by Abu &lsquo;l-Bak&#257; S&#257;lih ar-Rundi; the form of the <i>Coplas</i>
is influenced by the <i>Consejos</i> of his uncle, Gómez Manrique,
and the matter derives from the Bible, from Boethius and from
other sources readily accessible. The great sonorous commonplaces
on death are vitalized by the intensely personal grief of
the poet, who lent a new solemnity and significance to thoughts
which had been for centuries the common property of mankind.
It was given to Jorge Manrique to have one single moment of
sublime expression, and this isolated achievement has won him
a fame undimmed by any change of taste during four centuries.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The best edition of the <i>Coplas</i> is that issued by R. Foulché-Delbosc
in the <i>Bibliotheca hispanica</i>; the poem has been admirably translated
by Longfellow. Manrique&rsquo;s other verses were mostly printed in
Hernando del Castillo&rsquo;s <i>Cancionero general</i> (1511).</p>

<p><span class="bold">MANSE<a name="ar136" id="ar136"></a></span> (Med. Lat. <i>mansa</i>, <i>mansus</i> or <i>mansum</i>, from <i>manere</i>,
to dwell, remain), originally a dwelling-house together with a
portion of land sufficient for the support of a family. It is
defined by Du Cange (<i>Glossarium, s.v. Mansus</i>) as <i>... certam
agri portionem quae coleretur et in qua coloni aedes esset</i>. The
term was particularly applied, in ecclesiastical law, to the house
and glebe to which every church was entitled by common right,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page599" id="page599"></a>599</span>
the rule of canon law being <i>sancitum est ut unicuique ecclesiae
unus mansus integer absque ullo servitio tribuatur</i> (Phillimore,
<i>Eccles. Law</i>, 1895, ii. 1125). The word is now chiefly used for
the residence of a minister of the Established Church of Scotland;
to this every minister of a rural parish is entitled, and the landed
proprietors must build and keep it up. &ldquo;Manse&rdquo; is also loosely
used for the residence of a minister of various Free Church
denominations (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Glebe</a></span>).</p>

<p><span class="bold">MANSEL, HENRY LONGUEVILLE<a name="ar137" id="ar137"></a></span> (1820-1871), English
philosopher, was born at Cosgrove, Northamptonshire (where his
father, also Henry Longueville Mansel, fourth son of General
John Mansel, was rector), on the 6th of October 1820. He was
educated at Merchant Taylors&rsquo; School and St John&rsquo;s College,
Oxford. He took a double first in 1843, and became tutor of his
college. He was appointed reader in moral and metaphysical
philosophy at Magdalen College in 1855, and Waynflete professor
in 1859. He was a great opponent of university reform and
of the Hegelianism which was then beginning to take root in
Oxford. In 1867 he succeeded A. P. Stanley as professor of
ecclesiastical history, and in 1868 he was appointed dean of St
Paul&rsquo;s. He died on the 31st of July 1871.</p>

<p>The philosophy of Mansel, like that of Sir William Hamilton,
was mainly due to Aristotle, Kant and Reid. Like Hamilton,
Mansel maintained the purely formal character of logic, the
duality of consciousness as testifying to both self and the
external world, and the limitation of knowledge to the finite
and &ldquo;conditioned.&rdquo; His doctrines were developed in his edition
of Aldrich&rsquo;s <i>Artis logicae rudimenta</i> (1849)&mdash;his chief contribution
to the reviving study of Aristotle&mdash;and in his <i>Prolegomena
logica: an Inquiry into the Psychological Character of Logical
Processes</i> (1851, 2nd ed. enlarged 1862), in which the limits of
logic as the &ldquo;science of formal thinking&rdquo; are rigorously determined.
In his Bampton lectures on <i>The Limits of Religious
Thought</i> (1858, 5th ed. 1867; Danish trans. 1888) he applied to
Christian theology the metaphysical agnosticism which seemed
to result from Kant&rsquo;s criticism, and which had been developed
in Hamilton&rsquo;s <i>Philosophy of the Unconditioned</i>. While denying
all knowledge of the supersensuous, Mansel deviated from Kant
in contending that cognition of the ego as it really is is itself
a fact of experience. Consciousness, he held&mdash;agreeing thus
with the doctrine of &ldquo;natural realism&rdquo; which Hamilton
developed from Reid&mdash;implies knowledge both of self and of
the external world. The latter Mansel&rsquo;s psychology reduces to
consciousness of our organism as extended; with the former is
given consciousness of free will and moral obligation. A
summary of his philosophy is contained in his article &ldquo;Metaphysics&rdquo;
in the 8th edition of the <i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i>
(separately published, 1860). Mansel wrote also <i>The Philosophy
of the Conditioned</i> (1866) in reply to Mill&rsquo;s criticism of Hamilton;
<i>Letters, Lectures, and Reviews</i> (ed. Chandler, 1873), and <i>The
Gnostic Heresies</i> (ed. J. B. Lightfoot, 1875, with a biographical
sketch by Lord Carnarvon). He wrote a commentary on the
first two gospels in the <i>Speaker&rsquo;s Commentary</i>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MANSFELD,<a name="ar138" id="ar138"></a></span> the name of an old and illustrious German family
which took its name from Mansfeld in Saxony, where it was
seated from the 11th to the 18th century. One of its earliest
members was Hoyer von Mansfeld (d. 1115), a partisan of the
emperor Henry V. during his struggles with the Saxons; he
fought for Henry at Warnstädt and was killed in his service at
Welfesholz. Still more famous was Albert, count of Mansfeld
(1480-1560), an intimate friend of Luther and one of the earliest
and staunchest supporters of the Reformation. He helped to crush
the rising of the peasants under Thomas Munzer in Thuringia
in 1525; he was a member of the league of Schmalkalden,
and took part in all the movements of the Protestants against
Charles V. With Albert was associated his brother Gebhard,
and another member of the family was Johann Gebhard, elector
of Cologne from 1558 to 1562. A scion of another branch of
the Mansfelds was Peter Ernst, Fürst von Mansfeld (1517-1604),
governor of Luxemburg, who unlike his kinsmen was loyal to
Charles V. He went with the emperor to Tunis and fought
for him in France. He was equally loyal to his son, Philip II.
of Spain, whom he served at St Quentin and in the Netherlands.
He distinguished himself in the field and found time to lead a
body of troops to aid the king of France against the Huguenots.
In this capacity he was present in 1569 at the battle of
Moncontour, where another member of his family, Count
Wolrad of Mansfeld (d. 1578) was among the Huguenot
leaders. The Mansfeld family became extinct in 1780 on the
death of Josef Wenzel Nepomuk, prince of Fondi, the lands
being divided between Saxony and Prussia.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MANSFELD, ERNST,<a name="ar139" id="ar139"></a></span> <span class="sc">Graf von</span> (<i>c.</i> 1580-1626), German
soldier, was an illegitimate son of Peter Ernst, Fürst von Mansfeld,
and passed his early years in his father&rsquo;s palace at Luxemburg.
He gained his earliest military experiences in Hungary, where
his half-brother Charles (1543-1595,) also a soldier of renown,
held a high command in the imperial army. Later he served
under the Archduke Leopold, until that prince&rsquo;s ingratitude,
real or fancied, drove him into the arms of the enemies of the
house of Habsburg. Although remaining a Roman Catholic he
allied himself with the Protestant princes, and during the earlier
part of the Thirty Years&rsquo; War he was one of their foremost
champions. He was despatched by Charles Emmanuel, duke
of Savoy, at the head of about 2000 men to aid the revolting
Bohemians when war broke out in 1618. He took Pilsen, but
in the summer of 1619 he was defeated at Zablat; after this he
offered his services to the emperor Ferdinand II. and remained
inactive while the titular king of Bohemia, Frederick V., elector
palatine of the Rhine, was driven in headlong rout from Prague.
Mansfeld, however, was soon appointed by Frederick to command
his army in Bohemia, and in 1621 he took up his position in the
Upper Palatinate, successfully resisting the efforts made by
Tilly to dislodge him. From the Upper he passed into the
Rhenish Palatinate. Here he relieved Frankenthal and took
Hagenau; then, joined by his master, the elector Frederick, he
defeated Tilly at Wiesloch in April 1622 and plundered Alsace
and Hesse. But Mansfeld&rsquo;s ravages were not confined to the
lands of his enemies; they were ruinous to the districts he was
commissioned to defend. At length Frederick was obliged to
dismiss Mansfeld&rsquo;s troops from his service. Then joining
Christian of Brunswick the count led his army through Lorraine,
devastating the country as he went, and in August 1622 defeating
the Spaniards at Fleurus. He next entered the service of the
United Provinces and took up his quarters in East Friesland,
capturing fortresses and inflicting great hardships upon the
inhabitants. A mercenary and a leader of mercenaries, Mansfeld
often interrupted his campaigns by journeys made for the
purpose of raising money, or in other words of selling his services
to the highest bidder, and in these diplomatic matters he showed
considerable skill. About 1624 he paid three visits to London,
where he was hailed as a hero by the populace, and at least one
to Paris. James I. was anxious to furnish him with men and
money for the recovery of the palatinate, but it was not until
January 1625 that Mansfeld and his army of &ldquo;raw and poor
rascals&rdquo; sailed from Dover to the Netherlands. Later in the
year, the Thirty Years&rsquo; War having been renewed under the
leadership of Christian IV., king of Denmark, he re-entered
Germany to take part therein. But on the 25th of April 1626
Wallenstein inflicted a severe defeat upon him at the bridge of
Dessau. Mansfeld, however, quickly raised another army,
with which he intended to attack the hereditary lands of the
house of Austria, and pursued by Wallenstein he pressed forward
towards Hungary, where he hoped to accomplish his purpose
by the aid of Bethlem Gabor, prince of Transylvania. But when
Gabor changed his policy and made peace with the emperor,
Mansfeld was compelled to disband his troops. He set out for
Venice, but when he reached Rakowitza he was taken ill, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page600" id="page600"></a>600</span>
here he died on the 29th of November 1626. He was buried
at Spalato.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MANSFIELD, RICHARD<a name="ar140" id="ar140"></a></span> (1857-1907), American actor, was
born on the 24th of May 1857, in Berlin, his mother being
Madame [Erminia] Rudersdorff (1822-1882), the singer, and his
father, Maurice Mansfield (d. 1861), a London wine merchant.
He first appeared on the stage at St George&rsquo;s Hall, London,
and then drifted into light opera, playing the Major-General
in <i>The Pirates of Penzance</i>, and the Lord High Executioner in
<i>The Mikado</i>, both in the English provinces and in America.
In 1883 he joined A. M. Palmer&rsquo;s Union Square theatre company
in New York, and made a great hit as Baron Chevrial in <i>A
Parisian Romance</i>. He appeared successfully in several plays
adapted from well-known stories, and his rendering (1887) of
the doubled title-parts in R. L. Stevenson&rsquo;s <i>Strange Case of
Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde</i> created a profound impression. It was
with this play that he made his London reputation during a
season (1888) at the Lyceum theatre, by invitation of Henry
Irving. He produced Richard III. the next year at the Globe.
Among his other chief successes were <i>Prince Karl</i>, <i>Cyrano de
Bergerac</i> and <i>Monsieur Beaucaire</i>. He was one of the earliest
to produce G. Bernard Shaw&rsquo;s plays in America, appearing in
1894 as Bluntschli in <i>Arms and the Man</i>, and as Dick Dudgeon
in <i>The Devil&rsquo;s Disciple</i> in 1897. As a manager and producer of
plays Mansfield was remarkable for his lavish staging. He died
in New London, Connecticut, on the 30th of August 1907.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MANSFIELD, WILLIAM MURRAY,<a name="ar141" id="ar141"></a></span> <span class="sc">1st Earl of</span> (1705-1793),
English judge, was born at Scone in Perthshire, on the
2nd of March 1705. He was a younger son of David Murray,
5th Viscount Stormont (<i>c.</i> 1665-1731), the dignity having been
granted in 1621 by James I. to his friend and helper, Sir David
Murray (d. 1631), a Scottish politician of some note. Lord
Stormont&rsquo;s family was Jacobite in its politics, and his second
son James (<i>c.</i> 1690-1728), being apparently mixed up in some
of the plots of the time, joined the court of the exiled Stuarts
and in 1721 was created earl of Dunbar by James Edward, the
Old Pretender.</p>

<p>William Murray was educated at Perth grammar school and
Westminster School, of which he was a king&rsquo;s scholar. Entering
Christ Church, Oxford, he graduated in 1727. A friend of the
family, Lord Foley, provided the funds for his legal training,
and he became a member of Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn on his departure
from Oxford, being called to the bar in 1730. He was a good
scholar and mixed with the best literary society, being an
intimate friend of Alexander Pope. His appearance in some
important Scottish appeal cases brought him into notice, and in
Scotland at least he acquired an immense reputation by his
appearance for the city of Edinburgh when it was threatened
with disfranchisement for the affair of the Porteous mob. His
English practice had as yet been scanty, but in 1737 a single
speech in a jury trial of note placed him at the head of the bar,
and from this time he had all he could attend to. In 1738 he
married Lady Elizabeth Finch, daughter of the earl of Winchelsea.
His political career began in 1742 with his appointment
as solicitor-general. During the next fourteen years he was one
of the most conspicuous figures in the parliamentary history
of the time. By birth a Jacobite, by association a Tory, he
was nevertheless a Moderate, and his politics were really dominated
by his legal interests. Although holding an office of
subordinate rank, he was the chief defender of the government
in the House of Commons, and during the time that Pitt was
in opposition had to bear the brunt of his attacks. In 1754
he became attorney-general, and for the next two years acted
as leader of the House of Commons under the administration
of the duke of Newcastle. But in 1756, when the government
was evidently approaching its fall, an unexpected vacancy
occurred in the chief justiceship of the king&rsquo;s bench, and he
claimed the office, being at the same time raised to the peerage
as Baron Mansfield.</p>

<p>From this time the chief interest of his career lies in his
judicial work, but he did not wholly dissever himself from
politics. He became by a singular arrangement, only repeated
in the case of Lord Ellenborough, a member of the cabinet,
and remained in that position through various changes of
administration for nearly fifteen years, and, although he persistently
refused the chancellorship, he acted as Speaker of the
House of Lords while the Great Seal was in commission. During
the time of Pitt&rsquo;s ascendancy he took but little part in politics,
but while Lord Bute was in power his influence was very considerable,
and seems mostly to have been exerted in favour of
a more moderate line of policy. He was on the whole a supporter
of the prerogative, but within definite limits. Macaulay terms
him, justly enough, &ldquo;the father of modern Toryism, of Toryism
modified to suit an order of things in which the House of
Commons is the most powerful body in the state.&rdquo; During
the stormy session of 1770 he came into violent collision with
Chatham and Camden in the questions that arose out of the
Middlesex election and the trials for political libel; and in the
subsequent years he was made the subject of the bitter attacks
of Junius, in which his early Jacobite connexions, and his
apparent leanings to arbitrary power, were used against him
with extraordinary ability and virulence. In 1776 he was
created earl of Mansfield. In 1783, although he declined to
re-enter the cabinet, he acted as Speaker of the House of Lords
during the coalition ministry, and with this his political career
may be said to have closed. He continued to act as chief
justice until his resignation in June 1788, and after five years
spent in retirement died on the 20th of March 1793. He left
no family, but his title had been re-granted in 1792 with a
direct remainder to his nephew David Murray, 7th Viscount
Stormont (1727-1796). The 2nd earl was ambassador to Vienna
and then to Paris; he was secretary of state for the southern
department from 1779 to 1782, and lord president of the council
in 1783, and again from 1794 until his death. In 1906 his
descendant Alan David Murray (b. 1864) became 6th earl of
Mansfield.</p>

<p>Lord Mansfield&rsquo;s great reputation rests chiefly on his judicial
career. The political trials over which he presided, although
they gave rise to numerous accusations against him, were
conducted with singular fairness and propriety. He was accused
with especial bitterness of favouring arbitrary power by the
law which he laid down in the trials for libel which arose out of
the publications of Junius and Horne Tooke, and which at a
later time he reaffirmed in the case of the dean of St Asaph
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Libel</a></span>). But we must remember that his view of the law
was concurred in by the great majority of the judges and lawyers
of that time, and was supported by undoubted precedents. In
other instances, when the government was equally concerned,
he was wholly free from suspicion. He supported Lord Camden&rsquo;s
decision against general warrants, and reversed the outlawry
of Wilkes. He was always ready to protect the rights of conscience,
whether they were claimed by Dissenters or Catholics,
and the popular fury which led to the destruction of his house
during the Gordon riots was mainly due to the fact that a
Catholic priest, who was accused of saying Mass, had escaped
the penal laws by his charge to the jury. His chief celebrity,
however, is founded upon the consummate ability with which
he discharged the civil duties of his office. He has always
been recognized as the founder of English mercantile law. The
common law as it existed before his time was wholly inadequate
to cope with the new cases and customs which arose with the
increasing development of commerce. The facts were left to
the jury to decide as best they might, and no principle was
ever extracted from them which might serve as a guide in
subsequent cases. Mansfield found the law in this chaotic
state, and left it in a form that was almost equivalent to a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page601" id="page601"></a>601</span>
code. He defined almost every principle that governed commercial
transactions in such a manner that his successors had
only to apply the rules he had laid down. His knowledge of
Roman and foreign law, and the general width of his education,
freed him from the danger of relying too exclusively upon
narrow precedents, and afforded him a storehouse of principles
and illustrations, while the grasp and acuteness of his intellect
enabled him to put his judgments in a form which almost
always commanded assent. A similar influence was exerted by
him in other branches of the common law; and although, after
his retirement, a reaction took place, and he was regarded for
a while as one who had corrupted the ancient principles of
English law, these prejudices passed rapidly away, and the value
of his work in bringing the older law into harmony with the
needs of modern society has long been fully recognized.</p>

Mansfield parliamentary division of Nottinghamshire, England,
on the small river Mann or Maun; the junction of several
branches of the Midland railway, by which it is 142 m. N.N.W.
from London. Pop. (1891), 13,094; (1901), 15,250. Area,
7068 acres. The church of St Peter is partly Early Norman,
and partly Perpendicular. There is a grammar school founded
by Queen Elizabeth in 1561, occupying modern buildings.
Twelve almshouses were founded by Elizabeth Heath in 1693,
and to these six were afterwards added. There are a number
of other charities. The industries are the manufacture of lace,
thread, boots and machinery, iron-founding and brewing.
In the neighbourhood, as at Mansfield Woodhouse to the north,
there are quarries of limestone, sandstone and freestone. The
town is governed by a mayor, 6 aldermen and 18 councillors.
During the heptarchy Mansfield was occasionally the residence
of the Mercian kings, and it was afterwards a favourite resort of
Norman sovereigns, lying as it does on the western outskirts
of Sherwood Forest. By Henry VIII. the manor was granted
to the earl of Surrey. Afterwards it went by exchange to the
duke of Newcastle, and thence to the Portland family. The
town obtained a fair from Richard II. in 1377. It became a
municipal borough in 1891.</p>

13,473; (1900), 17,640, of whom 1781 were foreign-born; (1910
census), 20,768. It is served by the Pennsylvania (Pittsburg,

fine residences. It is the seat of the Ohio state reformatory.
Mansfield has an extensive trade with the surrounding agricultural
country, but its largest interests are in manufactures.
The total factory product in 1905 was valued at $7,353,578.
There are natural gas wells in the vicinity. The waterworks
and the sewage disposal plant are owned and operated by the
municipality. Mansfield was laid out in 1808, and was named
in honour of Lieut.-Colonel Jared Mansfield (1759-1830), United
States surveyor of Ohio and the North-west Territory in 1803-1812,
and professor of natural and experimental philosophy at
West Point from 1812 to 1828. Mansfield was incorporated as
a village in 1828 and was first chartered as a city in 1857. It
was the home of John Sherman from 1840 until his death.</p>

a term applied in early English use to the principal house of the

<p><span class="bold">MANSON, GEORGE<a name="ar146" id="ar146"></a></span> (1850-1876), Scottish water-colour
painter, was born in Edinburgh on the 3rd of December 1850.
When about fifteen he was apprenticed as a woodcutter with
W. &amp; R. Chambers, with whom he remained for over five years,
diligently employing all his spare time in the study and practice
of art, and producing in his morning and evening hours water-colours
of much delicacy and beauty. In 1871 he devoted
himself exclusively to painting. His subjects were derived from
humble Scottish life&mdash;especially child-life, varied occasionally
by portraiture, by landscape, and by views of picturesque architecture.
In 1873 he visited Normandy, Belgium and Holland;
in the following year he spent several months in Sark; and in
1875 he resided at St Lô, and in Paris, where he mastered the
processes of etching. Meanwhile in his water-colour work he
had been adding more of breadth and power to the tenderness
and richness of colour which distinguished his early pictures,
and he was planning more complex and important subjects.
But his health had been gradually failing, and he was ordered
to Lympstone in Devonshire, where he died on the 27th of
February 1876.</p>

<p>A volume of photographs from his water-colours and sketches,

Ya &lsquo;q&#363;b ibn Y&#363;suf</span>, often described as Jacob Almanzor, of the
Moorish dynasty of the Almohades, conqueror of Alfonso III. in
the battle of Alarcos (1195); (4) <span class="sc">Ibn Ab&#299; &lsquo;&#256;mir Mahommed</span>,
commonly called Almanzor by European writers, of an ancient
but not illustrious Arab family, which had its seat at Torrox
near Algeciras. The last-named was born <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 939, and began
life as a lawyer at Cordova. In 967 he obtained a place at the
court of &#7716;akam II., the Andalusian caliph, and by an unusual
combination of the talents of a courtier with administrative
ability rapidly rose to distinction, enjoying the powerful support
of &#7778;ub&#7717;, the favourite of the caliph and mother of his heir
Hish&#257;m. The death of &#7716;akam (976) and the accession of a
minor gave fresh scope to his genius, and in 978 he became chief
minister. The weak young caliph was absorbed in exercises
of piety, but at first Man&#7779;&#363;r had to share the power with his father-in-law
Gh&#257;lib, the best general of Andalusia, and with the mother
of Hish&#257;m. At last a rupture took place between the two
ministers. Gh&#257;lib professed himself the champion of the caliph
and called in the aid of the Christians of Leon; but Man&#7779;&#363;r,
anticipating the struggle, had long before remodelled the army
and secured its support. Gh&#257;lib fell in battle (981); a victorious
campaign chastised the Leonese; and on his return to Cordova
the victor assumed his regal surname of <i>al-Man&#7779;&#363;r billah</i>, and
became practically sovereign of Andalusia. The caliph was a
mere prisoner of state, and Man&#7779;&#363;r ultimately assumed the title
as well as the prerogatives of king (996). Unscrupulous in the
means by which he rose to power, he wielded the sovereignty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page602" id="page602"></a>602</span>
nobly. His strict justice and enlightened administration were
not less notable than the military prowess by which he is best
known. His arms were the terror of the Christians, and raised
the Moslem power in Spain to a pitch it had never before attained.
In Africa his armies were for a time hard pressed by the revolt
of Z&#299;r&#299;, viceroy of Mauretania, but before his death this enemy
had also fallen. Mans&#363;r died at Medinaceli on the 10th of August
1002, and was succeeded by his son Mozaffar.</p>

<div class="center ptb6"><img style="width:200px; height:36px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img000.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p><span class="bold">MANTEGNA, ANDREA<a name="ar151" id="ar151"></a></span> (1431-1506), one of the chief heroes
in the advance of painting in Italy, was born in Vicenza, of very
humble parentage. It is said that in his earliest boyhood Andrea
was, like Giotto, put to shepherding or cattle-herding; this is
not likely, and can at any rate have lasted only a very short
while, as his natural genius for art developed with singular
precocity, and excited the attention of Francesco Squarcione,
who entered him in the gild of painters before he had completed
his eleventh year.</p>

<p>Squarcione, whose original vocation was tailoring, appears to
have had a remarkable enthusiasm for ancient art, and a proportionate
faculty for acting, with profit to himself and others,
as a sort of artistic middleman; his own performances as a painter
were merely mediocre. He travelled in Italy, and perhaps in
Greece also, collecting antique statues, reliefs, vases, &amp;c., forming
the largest collection then extant of such works, making drawings
from them himself, and throwing open his stores for others to
study from, and then undertaking works on commission for
which his pupils no less than himself were made available. As
many as one hundred and thirty-seven painters and pictorial
students passed through his school, established towards 1440,
which became famous all over Italy. Mantegna was, as he
deserved to be, Squarcione&rsquo;s favourite pupil. Squarcione
adopted him as his son, and purposed making him the heir of
his fortune. Andrea was only seventeen when he painted, in the
church of S. Sofia in Padua, a Madonna picture of exceptional
and recognized excellence. He was no doubt fully aware of
having achieved no common feat, as he marked the work with
his name and the date, and the years of his age. This painting
was destroyed in the 17th century.</p>

<p>As the youth progressed in his studies, he came under the
influence of Jacopo Bellini, a painter considerably superior to
Squarcione, father of the celebrated painters Giovanni and
Gentile, and of a daughter Nicolosia; and in 1454 Jacopo gave
Nicolosia to Andrea in marriage. This connexion of Andrea with
the pictorial rival of Squarcione is generally assigned as the
reason why the latter became alienated from the son of his adoption,
and always afterwards hostile to him. Another suggestion,
which rests, however, merely on its own internal probability, is
that Squarcione had at the outset used his pupil Andrea as the
unavowed executant of certain commissions, but that after a
while Andrea began painting on his own account, thus injuring
the professional interests of his chief. The remarkably definite
and original style formed by Mantegna may be traced out as
founded on the study of the antique in Squarcione&rsquo;s atelier,
followed by a diligent application of principles of work exemplified
by Paolo Uccello and Donatello, with the practical guidance
and example of Jacopo Bellini in the sequel.</p>

<p>Among the other early works of Mantegna are the fresco of
two saints over the entrance porch of the church of S. Antonio
in Padua, 1452, and an altar-piece of St Luke and other saints
for the church of S. Giustina, now in the Brera Gallery in Milan,
1453. It&rsquo;s probable, however, that before this time some of the
pupils of Squarcione, including Mantegna, had already begun
that series of frescoes in the chapel of S. Cristoforo, in the church
of S. Agostino degli Eremitani, by which the great painter&rsquo;s
reputation was fully confirmed, and which remain to this day conspicuous
among his finest achievements.<a name="fa1t" id="fa1t" href="#ft1t"><span class="sp">1</span></a> The now censorious
Squarcione found much to carp at in the earlier works of this
series, illustrating the life of St James; he said the figures were
like men of stone, and had better have been coloured stone-colour
at once. Andrea, conscious as he was of his own great faculty
and mastery, seems nevertheless to have felt that there was
something in his old preceptor&rsquo;s strictures; and the later subjects,
from the legend of St Christopher, combine with his other excellences
more of natural character and vivacity. Trained as he
had been to the study of marbles and the severity of the antique,
and openly avowing that he considered the antique superior to
nature as being more eclectic in form, he now and always affected
precision of outline, dignity of idea and of figure, and he thus
tended towards rigidity, and to an austere wholeness rather
than gracious sensitiveness of expression. His draperies are
tight and closely folded, being studied (as it is said) from models
draped in paper and woven fabrics gummed. Figures slim,
muscular and bony, action impetuous but of arrested energy,
tawny landscape, gritty with littering pebbles, mark the athletic
hauteur of his style. He never changed, though he developed
and perfected, the manner which he had adopted in Padua; his
colouring, at first rather neutral and undecided, strengthened
and matured. There is throughout his works more balancing
of colour than fineness of tone. One of his great aims was optical
illusion, carried out by a mastery of perspective which, though
not always impeccably correct, nor absolutely superior in principle
to the highest contemporary point of attainment, was
worked out by himself with strenuous labour, and an effect of
actuality astonishing in those times.</p>

<p>Successful and admired though he was in Padua, Mantegna
left his native city at an early age, and never afterwards resettled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page603" id="page603"></a>603</span>
there; the hostility of Squarcione has been assigned as the cause.
The rest of his life was passed in Verona, Mantua and Rome&mdash;chiefly
Mantua; Venice and Florence have also been named, but
without confirmation.</p>

<p>It may have been in 1459 that he went to Verona; and he
painted, though not on the spot, a grand altar-piece for the church
of S. Zeno, a Madonna and angels, with four saints on each side.
The Marquis Lodovico Gonzaga of Mantua had for some time
been pressing Mantegna to enter his service; and the following
year, 1460, was perhaps the one in which he actually established
himself at the Mantuan court, residing at first from time to time
at Goito, but, from December 1466 onwards, with his family in
Mantua itself. His engagement was for a salary of 75 lire
(about £30) a month, a sum so large for that period as to mark
conspicuously the high regard in which his art was held. He
was in fact the first painter of any eminence ever domiciled in
Mantua. He built a stately house in the city, and adorned it
with a multitude of paintings. The house remains, but the
pictures have perished. Some of his early Mantuan works are
in that apartment of the Castello which is termed the Camera
degli Sposi&mdash;full compositions in fresco, including various
portraits of the Gonzaga family, and some figures of genii, &amp;c.
In 1488 he went to Rome at the request of Pope Innocent VIII.,
to paint the frescoes in the chapel of the Belvedere in the Vatican;
the marquis of Mantua (Federigo) created him a cavaliere before
his departure. This series of frescoes, including a noted &ldquo;Baptism
of Christ,&rdquo; was ruthlessly destroyed by Pius VI. in laying
out the Museo Pio-Clementino. The pope treated Mantegna
with less liberality than he had been used to at the Mantuan
court; but on the whole their connexion, which ceased in 1490,
was not unsatisfactory to either party. Mantegna then returned
to Mantua, and went on with a series of works&mdash;the nine tempera-pictures,
each of them 9 ft. square, of the &ldquo;Triumph of Caesar&rdquo;&mdash;which
he had probably begun before his leaving for Rome, and
which are now in Hampton Court. These superbly invented
and designed compositions, gorgeous with all splendour of
subject-matter and accessory, and with the classical learning
and enthusiasm of one of the master-spirits of the age, have
always been accounted of the first rank among Mantegna&rsquo;s
works. They were sold in 1628 along with the bulk of the
Mantuan art treasures, and were not, as is commonly said,
plundered in the sack of Mantua in 1630. They are now greatly
damaged by patchy repaintings. Another work of Mantegna&rsquo;s
later years was the so-called &ldquo;Madonna della Vittoria,&rdquo; now in
the Louvre. It was painted in tempera about 1495, in commemoration
of the battle of Fornovo, which <span class="correction" title="amended from Ginfrancesco">Gianfrancesco</span>
Gonzaga found it convenient to represent to his lieges as an
Italian victory, though in fact it had been a French victory; the
church which originally housed the picture was built from
Mantegna&rsquo;s own design. The Madonna is here depicted with
various saints, the archangel Michael and St Maurice holding
her mantle, which is extended over the kneeling Gianfrancesco
Gonzaga, amid a profusion of rich festooning and other accessory.
Though not in all respects of his highest order of execution,
this counts among the most obviously beautiful and attractive
of Mantegna&rsquo;s works&mdash;from which the qualities of beauty and
attraction are often excluded, in the stringent pursuit of those
other excellences more germane to his severe genius, tense energy
passing into haggard passion.</p>

<p>Vasari eulogizes Mantegna for his courteous, distinguished
and praiseworthy deportment, although there are indications
of his having been not a little litigious in disposition. With his
fellow-pupils at Padua he had been affectionate; and for two of
them, Dario da Trevigi and Marco Zoppo, he retained a steady
friendship. That he had a high opinion of himself was natural,
for no artist of his epoch could produce more manifest vouchers
of marked and progressive attainment. He became very expensive
in his habits, fell at times into difficulties, and had to urge
his valid claims upon the marquis&rsquo;s attention. After his return
to Mantua from Rome his prosperity was at its height, until the
death of his wife. He then formed some other connexion, and
became at an advanced age the father of a natural son, Giovanni
Andrea; and at the last, although he continued launching out into
various expenses and schemes, he had serious tribulations, such
as the banishment from Mantua of his son Francesco, who had
incurred the marquis&rsquo;s displeasure. Perhaps the aged master
and connoisseur regarded as barely less trying the hard necessity
of parting with a beloved antique bust of Faustina. Very soon
after this transaction he died in Mantua, on the 13th of September
1506. In 1517 a handsome monument was set up to him
by his sons in the church of S. Andrea, where he had painted
the altar-piece of the mortuary chapel.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Mantegna was no less eminent as an engraver, though his history
in that respect is somewhat obscure, partly because he never signed
or dated any of his plates, unless in one single disputed instance,
1472. The account which has come down to us is that Mantegna
began engraving in Rome, prompted by the engravings produced
by Baccio Baldini of Florence after Sandro Botticelli; nor is there
anything positive to invalidate this account, except the consideration
that it would consign all the numerous and elaborate engravings made
by Mantegna to the last sixteen or seventeen years of his life, which
seems a scanty space for them, and besides the earlier engravings
indicate an earlier period of his artistic style. It has been suggested
that he began engraving while still in Padua, under the tuition
of a distinguished goldsmith, Niccolò. He engraved about fifty
plates, according to the usual reckoning; some thirty of them are
mostly accounted indisputable&mdash;often large, full of figures, and
highly studied. Some recent connoisseurs, however, ask us to restrict
to seven the number of his genuine extant engravings&mdash;which
appears unreasonable. Among the principal examples are &ldquo;Roman
Triumphs&rdquo; (not the same compositions as the Hampton Court
pictures), &ldquo;A Bacchanal Festival,&rdquo; &ldquo;Hercules and Antaeus,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Marine Gods,&rdquo; &ldquo;Judith with the Head of Holophernes,&rdquo; the
&ldquo;Deposition from the Cross,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Entombment,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Resurrection,&rdquo;
the &ldquo;Man of Sorrows,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Virgin in a Grotto.&rdquo; Mantegna
has sometimes been credited with the important invention of engraving
with the burin on copper. This claim cannot be sustained on a
comparison of dates, but at any rate he introduced the art into upper
Italy. Several of his engravings are supposed to be executed on
some metal less hard than copper. The technique of himself and his
followers is characterized by the strongly marked forms of the design,
and by the oblique formal hatchings of the shadows. The prints
are frequently to be found in two states, or editions. In the first
state the prints have been taken off with the roller, or even by hand-pressing,
and they are weak in tint; in the second state the printing
press has been used, and the ink is stronger.</p>

<p>The influence of Mantegna on the style and tendency of his age
was very marked, and extended not only to his own flourishing
Mantuan school, but over Italian art generally. His vigorous
perspectives and trenchant foreshortenings pioneered the way to
other artists: in solid antique taste, and the power of reviving the
aspect of a remote age with some approach to system and consistency,
he distanced all contemporary competition. He did not, however,
leave behind him many scholars of superior faculty. His two legitimate
sons were painters of only ordinary ability. His favourite
pupil was known as Carlo del Mantegna; Caroto of Verona was
another pupil, Bonsignori an imitator. Giovanni Bellini, in his
earlier works, obviously followed the lead of his brother-in-law
Andrea.</p>

<p>The works painted by Mantegna, apart from his frescoes, are not
numerous; some thirty-five to forty are regarded as fully authenticated.
We may name, besides those already specified&mdash;in the Naples
Museum, &ldquo;St Euphemia,&rdquo; a fine early work; in Casa Melzi, Milan,
the &ldquo;Madonna and Child with Chanting Angels&rdquo; (1461); in the Tribune
of the Uffizi, Florence, three pictures remarkable for scrupulous
finish; in the Berlin Museum, the &ldquo;Dead Christ with two Angels&rdquo;;
in the Louvre, the two celebrated pictures of mythic allegory&mdash;&ldquo;Parnassus&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Minerva Triumphing over the Vices&rdquo;; in the
National Gallery, London, the &ldquo;Agony in the Garden,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Virgin
and Child Enthroned, with the Baptist and the Magdalen,&rdquo; a late
example; the monochrome of &ldquo;Vestals,&rdquo; brought from Hamilton
Palace; the &ldquo;Triumph of Scipio&rdquo; (or Phrygian Mother of the Gods
received by the Roman Commonwealth), a tempera in chiaroscuro,
painted only a few months before the master&rsquo;s death; in the Brera,
Milan, the &ldquo;Dead Christ, with the two Maries weeping,&rdquo; a remarkable
<i>tour de force</i> in the way of foreshortening, which, though it has a
stunted appearance, is in correct technical perspective as seen from
all points of view. With all its exceptional merit, this is an eminently
ugly picture. It remained in Mantegna&rsquo;s studio unsold at his death,
and was disposed of to liquidate debts.</p>

<p>Not to speak of earlier periods, a great deal has been written
concerning Mantegna of late years. See the works by Maud Crutwell
(1901), Paul Kristeller (1901), H. Thode (1897), Paul Yriarte (1901),
Julia Cartwright, <i>Mantegna and Francia</i> (1881).</p>

<p><span class="bold">MANTELL, GIDEON ALGERNON<a name="ar152" id="ar152"></a></span> (1790-1852), English
geologist and palaeontologist, was born in 1790 at Lewes,
Sussex. Educated for the medical profession, he first practised
in his native town, afterwards in 1835 in Brighton, and finally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page604" id="page604"></a>604</span>
at Clapham, near London. He found time to prosecute
researches on the palaeontology of the Secondary rocks,
particularly in Sussex&mdash;a region which he made classical in
the history of discovery. While he was still a country doctor
at Lewes his eminence as a geological investigator was fully
recognized on the publication of his work on <i>The Fossils of
the South Downs</i> (1822). His most remarkable discoveries
were made in the Wealden formations. He demonstrated the
fresh-water origin of the strata, and from them he brought to
light and described the remarkable Dinosaurian reptiles known
as <i>Iguanodon</i>, <i>Hylaeosaurus</i>, <i>Pelorosaurus</i> and <i>Regnosaurus</i>.
For these researches he was awarded the Wollaston medal by
the Geological Society and a Royal medal by the Royal Society.
He was elected F.R.S. in 1825. Among his other contributions
to the literature of palaeontology was his description of
the Triassic reptile <i>Telerpelon elginense</i>. Towards the end of
his life Dr Mantell retired to London, where he died on the
10th of November 1852. His eldest son, <span class="sc">Walter Baldock
Durrant Mantell</span> (1820-1895), settled in New Zealand, and
there attained high public positions, eventually being secretary
for Crown-lands. He obtained remains of the <i>Notornis</i>, a
recently extinct bird, and also brought forward evidence to show
that the moas were contemporaries of man.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MANTES-SUR-SEINE,<a name="ar153" id="ar153"></a></span> a town of northern France, capital of
an arrondissement in the department of Seine-et-Oise on the left
bank of the Seine, 34 m. W.N.W. of Paris by rail. Pop. (1906),
8113. The chief building in Mantes is the celebrated church
of Notre-Dame which dates in the main from the end of the 12th
century. A previous edifice was burnt down by William the
Conqueror together with the rest of the town, at the capture of
which he lost his life in 1087; he is said to have bequeathed a
large sum for the rebuilding of the church. The plan, which
bears a marked resemblance to that of Notre-Dame at Paris,
includes a nave, aisles and choir, but no transepts. Three portals
open into the church on the west, the two northernmost, which
date from the 12th century, being decorated with fine carving;
that to the south is of the 14th century and still more ornate.
A fine rose-window and an open gallery, above which rise the
summits of the western towers, occupy the upper part of the
façade. In the interior, chapels dating from the 13th and
14th centuries are of interest. The tower of St Maclou (14th
century), relic of an old church and the hôtel de ville (15th to 17th
centuries), are among the older buildings of the town, and there is
a fountain of the Renaissance period. Modern bridges and a
medieval bridge unite Mantes with the opposite bank of the Seine
on which the town of Limay is built. The town has a sub-prefecture
and a tribunal of first instance. Mantes was occupied
by the English from 1346 to 1364, and from 1416 to 1449.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MANTEUFFEL, EDWIN,<a name="ar154" id="ar154"></a></span> <span class="sc">Freiherr von</span> (1809-1885), Prussian
general field marshal, son of the president of the superior
court of Magdeburg, was born at Dresden on the 24th of February
1809. He was brought up with his cousin, Otto von Manteuffel
(1805-1882), the Prussian statesman, entered the guard cavalry
at Berlin in 1827, and became an officer in 1828. After attending
the War Academy for two years, and serving successively as
aide-de-camp to General von Müffling and to Prince Albert of
Prussia, he was promoted captain in 1843 and major in 1848,
when he became aide-de-camp to Frederick William IV., whose
confidence he had gained during the revolutionary movement
in Berlin. Promoted lieutenant-colonel in 1852, and colonel to
command the 5th Uhlans in 1853, he was sent on important
diplomatic missions to Vienna and St Petersburg. In 1857 he
became major-general and chief of the military cabinet. He
gave hearty support to the prince regent&rsquo;s plans for the reorganization
of the army. In 1861 he was violently attacked in a
pamphlet by Karl Twesten (1820-1870), a Liberal leader, whom
he wounded in a duel. He served as lieutenant-general (to
which rank he was promoted on the coronation of William I.,
Oct. 18, 1861) in the Danish war of 1864, and at its conclusion
was appointed civil and military governor of Schleswig. In the
Austrian War of 1866 he first occupied Holstein and afterwards
commanded a division under Vogel von Falkenstein in the
Hanoverian campaign, and succeeded him, in July, in command
of the Army of the Main (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Seven Weeks&rsquo; War</a></span>). His successful
operations ended with the occupation of Würzburg, and
he received the order <i>pour le mérite</i>. He was, however, on
account of his monarchist political views and almost bigoted
Roman Catholicism, regarded by the parliament as a reactionary,
and, unlike the other army commanders, he was not granted
a money reward for his services. He then went on a diplomatic
mission to St Petersburg, where he was <i>persona grata</i>, and succeeded
in gaining Russia&rsquo;s assent to the new position in north
Germany. On returning he was gazetted to the colonelcy of
the 5th Dragoons. He was appointed to the command of the
IX. (Schleswig-Holstein) army corps in 1866. But having
formerly exercised both civil and military control in the Elbe
duchies he was unwilling to be a purely military commander
under one of his late civil subordinates, and retired from the
army for a year. In 1868, however, he returned to active service.
In the Franco-German War of 1870-71 he commanded the
I. corps under Steinmetz, distinguishing himself in the battle of
Colombey-Neuilly, and in the repulse of Bazaine at Noisseville
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Franco-German War</a></span>; and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Metz</a></span>). He succeeded Steinmetz
in October in the command of the I. army, won the battle of
Amiens against General Farre, and occupied Rouen, but was less
fortunate against Faidherbe at Pont Noyelles and Bapaume.
In January 1871 he commanded the newly formed Army of the
South, which he led, in spite of hard frost, through the Côte d&rsquo;Or
and over the plateau of Langres, cut off Bourbaki&rsquo;s army of the
east (80,000 men), and, after the action of Pontarlier, compelled
it to cross the Swiss frontier, where it was disarmed. His
immediate reward was the Grand Cross of the order of the Iron
Cross, and at the conclusion of peace he received the Black Eagle.
When the Southern Army was disbanded Manteuffel commanded
first the II. army, and, from June 1871 until 1873, the army of
occupation left in France, showing great tact in a difficult
position. On leaving France at the close of the occupation, the
emperor promoted Manteuffel to the rank of general field marshal
and awarded him a large grant in money, and about the same
time Alexander II. of Russia gave him the order of St Andrew.
After this he was employed on several diplomatic missions, was
for a time governor of Berlin, and in 1879, perhaps, as was commonly
reported, because he was considered by Bismarck as a
formidable rival, he was appointed governor-general of Alsace-Lorraine;
and this office he exercised&mdash;more in the spirit, some
said, of a Prussian than of a German official&mdash;until his death
at Carlsbad, Bohemia, on the 17th of June 1885.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MANTINEIA,<a name="ar155" id="ar155"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Mantinea</span>, an ancient city of Arcadia,
Greece, situated in the long narrow plain running north and
south, which is now called after the chief town Tripolitsa.
Tegea was in the same valley, about 10 m. S. of Mantineia,
and the two cities continually disputed the supremacy of the
district. In every great war we find them ranged on opposite
sides, except when superior force constrained both. The
worship and mysteries of Cora at Mantineia were famous.
The valley in which the city lies has no opening to the coast,
and the water finds its way, often only with much care and
artificial aid, through underground passages (<i>katavothra</i>) to
the sea. It is bounded on the west by Mount Maenalus, on
the east by Mount Artemision.</p>

<p>Mantineia is mentioned in the Homeric catalogue of ships,
but in early Greek times existed only as a cluster of villages
inhabited by a purely agricultural community. In the 6th
century it was still insignificant as compared with the neighbouring
city of Tegea, and submitted more readily to Spartan
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page605" id="page605"></a>605</span>
overlordship. The political history of Mantineia begins soon
after the Persian wars, when its five constituent villages, at
the suggestion of Argos, were merged into one city, whose
military strength forthwith secured it a leading position in the
Peloponnesus. Its policy was henceforth guided by three
main considerations. Its democratic constitution, which
seems to have been entirely congenial to the population of
small freeholders, and its ambition to gain control over the
Alpheus watershed and both the Arcadian high roads to the
isthmus, frequently estranged Mantineia from Sparta and
threw it into the arms of Argos. But the chronic frontier
disputes with Tegea, which turned the two cities into bitter
enemies, contributed most of all to determine their several
policies. About 469 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> Mantineia alone of Arcadian townships
refused to join the league of Tegea and Argos against
Sparta. Though formally enrolled on the same side during
the Peloponnesian War the two cities used the truce of 423 to
wage a fierce but indecisive war with each other. In the time
following the peace of Nicias the Mantineians, whose attempts
at expansion beyond Mount Maenalus were being foiled by
Sparta, formed a powerful alliance with Argos, Elis and Athens
(420), which the Spartans, assisted by Tegea, broke up after
a pitched battle in the city&rsquo;s territory (418). In the subsequent
years Mantineia still found opportunity to give the
Athenians covert help, and during the Corinthian War (394-387)
scarcely disguised its sympathy with the anti-Spartan
league. In 385 the Spartans seized a pretext to besiege and
dismantle Mantineia and to scatter its inhabitants among
four villages. The city was reconstituted after the battle of
Leuctra and under its statesman Lycomedes played a prominent
part in organizing the Arcadian League (370). But
the long-standing jealousy against Tegea, and a recent one
against the new foundation of Megalopolis, created dissensions
which resulted in Mantineia passing over to the Spartan side.
In the following campaign of 362 Mantineia, after narrowly
escaping capture by the Theban general Epaminondas, became
the scene of a decisive conflict in which the latter achieved
a notable victory but lost his own life. After the withdrawal
of the Thebans from Arcadia Mantineia failed to recover
its pre-eminence from Megalopolis, with which city it had
frequent disputes. In contrast with the Macedonian sympathies
of Megalopolis Mantineia joined the leagues against
Antipater (322) and Antigonus Gonatas (266). A change of
constitution, imposed perhaps by the Macedonians, was nullified
(about 250) by a revolution through which democracy was
restored. About 235 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> Mantineia entered the Achaean
League, from which it had obtained protection against Spartan
encroachments, but soon passed in turn to the Aetolians and
to Cleomenes III. of Sparta. A renewed defection, inspired
apparently by aversion to the aristocratic government of the
Achaeans and jealousy of Megalopolis, was punished in 222
by a thorough devastation of the city, which was now reconstituted
as a dependency of Argos and renamed Antigoneia
in honour of the Achaeans&rsquo; ally Antigonus Doson. Mantineia
regained its autonomous position in the Achaean League
in 192, and its original name during a visit of the emperor
Hadrian in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 133. Under the later Roman Empire the
city dwindled into a mere village, which since the 6th century
bore the Slavonic name of Goritza. It finally became a prey
to the malaria which arose when the plain fell out of cultivation,
and under Turkish rule disappeared altogether.</p>

<div class="center ptb2"><img style="width:913px; height:693px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img605.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>The site was excavated by M. Fougères, of the French School
at Athens, in 1888. The plan of the agora and adjacent buildings
has been recovered, and the walls have been completely
investigated. The town was situated in an unusual position
for a Greek city, on a flat marshy plain, and its walls form a
regular ellipse about 2½ m. in circumference. When the town
was first formed in 470 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> by the &ldquo;synoecism&rdquo; of the neighbouring
villages, the river Ophis flowed through the midst of
it, and the Spartan king Agesipolis dammed it up below the
town and so flooded out the Mantineians and sapped their
walls, which were of unbaked brick. Accordingly, when the
city was rebuilt in 370 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, the river Ophis was divided into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page606" id="page606"></a>606</span>
two branches, which between them encircled the walls; and
the walls themselves were constructed to a height of about
3 to 6 feet of stone, the rest being of unbaked brick. These
are the walls of which the remains are still extant. There are
towers about every 80 ft.; and the gates are so arranged that
the passage inwards usually runs from right to left, and so
an attacking force would have to expose its right or shieldless
side. Within the walls the most conspicuous landmark is
the theatre, which, unlike the majority of Greek theatres,
consists entirely of an artificial mound standing up from the
level plain. Only about a quarter of its original height remains.
Its <i>scena</i> is of rather irregular shape, and borders one of the
narrow ends of the agora. Close to it are the foundations
of several temples, one of them sacred to the hero Podaros.
The agora is of unsymmetrical form; its sides are bordered
by porticoes, interrupted by streets, like the primitive agora of
Elis as described by Pausanias, and unlike the regular agoras
of Ionic type. Most of these porticoes were of Roman period&mdash;the
finest of them were erected, as we learn from inscriptions,
by a lady named Epigone: one, which faced south, had a double
colonnade, and was called the <span class="grk" title="Baitê">&#914;&#945;&#943;&#964;&#951;</span>: close to it was a large
exedra. The foundations of a square market-hall of earlier
date were found beneath this. On the opposite side of the
agora was an extensive Bouleuterion or senate-house. Traces
remain of paved roads both within the agora and leading out
of it; but the whole site is now a deserted and feverish swamp.
The site is interesting for comparison with Megalopolis; the
nature of its plan seems to imply that its main features must
survive from the earlier &ldquo;synoecism&rdquo; a century before the
time of Epaminondas.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MANTIS<a name="ar156" id="ar156"></a></span>, an insect belonging to the order <i>Orthoptera</i>. Probably
no other insect has been the subject of so many and widespread
legends and superstitions as the common &ldquo;praying
mantis,&rdquo; <i>Mantis religiosa</i>, L. The ancient Greeks endowed
it with supernatural powers (<span class="grk" title="mantis">&#956;&#940;&#957;&#964;&#953;&#962;</span>, a diviner); the Turks and
Arabs hold that it prays constantly with its face turned
towards Mecca; the Provençals call it <i>Prega-Diou</i> (<i>Prie-Dieu</i>);
and numerous more or less similar names&mdash;preacher, saint,
nun, mendicant, soothsayer, &amp;c.&mdash;are widely diffused throughout
southern Europe. In Nubia it is held in great esteem,
and the Hottentots, if not indeed worshipping the local species
(<i>M. fausta</i>), as one traveller has alleged, at least appear to
regard its alighting upon any person both as a token of saintliness
and an omen of good fortune.</p>

<p>Yet these are &ldquo;not the saints but the tigers of the insect
world.&rdquo; The front pair of limbs are very peculiarly modified&mdash;the
coxa being greatly elongated, while the strong third joint
or femur bears on its curved underside a channel armed on
each edge by strong movable spines. Into this groove the
stout tibia is capable of closing like the blade of a pen-knife,
its sharp, serrated edge being adapted to cut and hold. Thus
armed, with head raised upon the much-elongated and semi-erect
prothorax, and with the half-opened fore-limbs held
outwards in the characteristic devotional attitude, it rests
motionless upon the four posterior limbs waiting for prey,
or occasionally stalks it with slow and silent movements, finally
seizing it with its knife-blades and devouring it. Although
apparently not daring to attack ants, these insects destroy
great numbers of flies, grasshoppers and caterpillars, and
the larger South-American species even attack small frogs,
lizards and birds. They are very pugnacious, fencing with
their sword-like limbs &ldquo;like hussars with sabres,&rdquo; the larger
frequently devouring the smaller, and the females the males.
The Chinese keep them in bamboo cages, and match them
like fighting-cocks.</p>

<p>The common species fixes its somewhat nut-like egg capsules
on the stems of plants in September. The young are hatched
in early summer, and resemble the adults, but are without
wings.</p>

<p>The green coloration and shape of the typical mantis are
procryptic, serving to conceal the insect alike from its enemies
and prey. The passage from leaf to flower simulation is but
a step which, without interfering with the protective value
of the coloration so far as insectivorous foes are concerned,
carries with it the additional advantage of attracting flower-feeding
insects within reach of the raptorial limbs. This
method of allurement has been perfected in certain tropical
species of <i>Mantidae</i> by the development on the prothorax
and raptorial limbs of laminate expansions so coloured on
the under side as to resemble papilionaceous or other blossoms,
to which the likeness is enhanced by a gentle swaying kept
up by the insect in imitation of the effect of a lightly blowing
breeze. As instances of this may be cited <i>Idalum diabolicum</i>,
an African insect, and <i>Gongylus gongyloides</i>, which comes
from India. Examples of another species (<i>Empusa eugena</i>)
when standing upon the ground deceptively imitate in shape
and hue a greenish white anemone tinted at the edges with
rose; and Bates records what appears to be a true case of
aggressive mimicry practised by a Brazilian species which
exactly resembles the white ants it preys upon.</p>


<div class="center ptb6"><img style="width:200px; height:36px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img000.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p><span class="bold">MANTIS-FLY,<a name="ar157" id="ar157"></a></span> the name given to neuropterous insects of
the family <i>Mantispidae</i>, related to the ant-lions, lace-wing
flies, &amp;c., and named from their superficial resemblance to
a <i>Mantis</i> owing to the length of the prothorax and the shape
and prehensorial nature of the anterior legs. The larva, at
first campodeiform, makes its way into the egg-case of a spider
or the nest of a wasp to feed upon the eggs or young. Subsequently
it changes into a fat grub with short legs. When
full grown it spins a silken cocoon in which the transformation
into the pupa is effected. The latter escapes from its double
case before moulting into the mature insect.</p>


<div class="center ptb6"><img style="width:200px; height:36px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img000.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p><span class="bold">MANTLE,<a name="ar158" id="ar158"></a></span> a long flowing cloak without sleeves, worn by
either sex. Particularly applied to the long robe worn over
the armour by the men-at-arms of the middle ages, the name
is still given to the robes of state of kings, peers, and the members
of an order of knights. Thus the &ldquo;electoral mantle&rdquo; was
a robe of office worn by the imperial electors, and the Teutonic
knights were known as the <i>orde alborum mantellorum</i> from
their white mantles. As an article of women&rsquo;s dress a mantle
now means a loose cloak or cape, of any length, and made
of silk, velvet, or other rich material. The word is derived
from the Latin <i>mantellum</i> or <i>mantelum</i>, a cloak, and is probably
the same as, or another form of, <i>mantelium</i> or <i>mantele</i>, a table-napkin
or table-cloth, from <i>manus</i>, hand, and <i>tela</i>, a cloth.
A late Latin <i>mantum</i>, from which several Romance languages
have taken words (cf. Ital. <i>manto</i>, and Fr. <i>mante</i>), must,
as the <i>New English Dictionary</i> points out, be a &ldquo;back-formation,&rdquo;
and this will explain the diminutive form of the Spanish
<i>mantilla</i>. From the old French <i>mantel</i> came the English
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page607" id="page607"></a>607</span>
compounds &ldquo;mantel-piece,&rdquo; &ldquo;mantel-shelf,&rdquo; for the stone
or wood beam which serves as a support for the structure above
a fire-place, together with the whole framework, whether of
wood, stone, &amp;c., that acts as an ornament of the same (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Chimneypiece</a></span>). The modern French form <i>manteau</i> is used
in English chiefly as a dressmaker&rsquo;s term for a woman&rsquo;s mantle.
&ldquo;Mantua,&rdquo; much used in the 18th century for a similar garment,
is probably a corruption of <i>manteau</i>, due to silk or other
materials coming from the Italian town of that name, and
known by the trade name of &ldquo;mantuas.&rdquo; The Spanish <i>mantilla</i>
is a covering for the head and shoulders of white or black lace
or other material, the characteristic head-dress of women in
southern and central Spain. It is occasionally seen in the
other parts of Spain and Spanish countries, and also in Portugal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mantle&rdquo; is used in many transferred senses, all with the
meaning of &ldquo;covering,&rdquo; as in zoology, for an enclosing sac
or integument; thus it is applied to the &ldquo;tunic&rdquo; or layer of
connective-tissue forming the body-wall of ascidians enclosing
muscle-fibres, blood-sinuses and nerves (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Tunicata</a></span>). The
term is also used for a meshed cap of refractory oxides employed
in systems of incandescent lighting (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Lighting</a></span>). The verb
is used for the creaming or frothing of liquids and of the suffusing
of the skin with blood. In heraldry &ldquo;mantling,&rdquo; also
known as &ldquo;panache,&rdquo; &ldquo;lambrequin&rdquo; or &ldquo;contoise,&rdquo; is an
ornamental appendage to an escutcheon, of flowing drapery,
forming a background (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Heraldry</a></span>).</p>

<p><span class="bold">MANTON, THOMAS<a name="ar159" id="ar159"></a></span> (1620-1677), English Nonconformist
divine, was born at Laurence Lydiard, Somerset, in 1620,
and was educated at Hart Hall, Oxford. Joseph Hall, bishop
of Norwich, ordained him deacon: he never took priest&rsquo;s orders,
holding that &ldquo;he was properly ordained to the ministerial
office.&rdquo; He was one of the clerks at the Westminster Assembly,
one of Cromwell&rsquo;s chaplains and a &ldquo;trier,&rdquo; and held livings
at Stoke Newington (1645) and St Paul&rsquo;s, Covent Garden
(1656). He disapproved of the execution of Charles I. In
1658 he assisted Baxter to draw up the &ldquo;Fundamentals of
Religion.&rdquo; He helped to restore Charles II. and became one
of his chaplains, refusing the deanery of Rochester. In 1662
he lost his living under the Act of Uniformity and preached
in his own rooms and in other parts of London. For this he
was arrested in 1670.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MANTUA<a name="ar161" id="ar161"></a></span> (Ital. <i>Mantova</i>), a fortified city of Lombardy,
Italy, the capital of the province of Mantua, the see of a bishop,
and the centre of a military district, 25 m. S.S.W. of Verona
and 100 m. E.S.E. of Milan by rail. Pop. (1906), 31,783.
It is situated 88 ft. above the level of the Adriatic on an almost
insular site in the midst of the swampy lagoons of the Mincio.
As the belt of marshy ground along the south side can be laid
under water at pleasure, the site of the city proper, exclusive
of the considerable suburbs of Borgo di Fortezza to the north
and Borgo di San Giorgio to the east, may still be said to consist,
as it formerly did more distinctly, of two islands separated
by a narrow channel and united by a number of bridges. On
the west side lies Lago Superiore, on the east side Lago Inferiore&mdash;the
boundary between the two being marked by the <i>Argine
del Mulino</i>, a long mole stretching northward from the north-west
angle of the city to the citadel.</p>

<p>On the highest ground in the city rises the cathedral, the
interior of which was built after his death according to the
plans of Giulio Romano; it has double aisles, a fine fretted
ceiling, a dome-covered transept, a bad baroque façade, and
a large unfinished Romanesque tower. Much more important
architecturally is the church of St Andrea, built towards the
close of the 15th century, after plans by Leon Battista Alberti,
and consisting of a single, barrel-vaulted nave 350 ft. long
by 62 ft. wide. It has a noble façade with a deeply recessed
portico, and a brick campanile of 1414. The interior is
decorated with 18th-century frescoes, to which period the dome
also belongs. Mantegna is buried in one of the side chapels.
S. Sebastiano is another work of Alberti&rsquo;s. The old ducal
palace&mdash;one of the largest buildings of its kind in Europe&mdash;was
begun in 1302 for Guido Bonaccolsi, and probably completed
in 1328 for Ludovico Gonzaga; but many of the accessory
apartments are of much later date, and the internal decorations
are for the most part the work of Giulio Romano and his pupils.
There are also some fine rooms of the early 19th century. Close
by are the Piazza dell&rsquo; Erbe and the Piazza Sordello, with
Gothic palaces. The Castello di Corte here, the old castle
of the Gonzagas (1395-1406), erected by Bartolino da Novara,
the architect of the castle of Ferrara, now contains the archives,
and has some fine frescoes by Mantegna with scenes from the
life of Ludovico Gonzaga. Outside of the city, to the south of
Porta Pusterla, stands the Palazzo del Te, Giulio&rsquo;s architectural
masterpiece, erected for Frederick Gonzaga in 1523-1535; of
the numerous fresco-covered chambers which it contains,
perhaps the most celebrated is the Sala dei Giganti, where,
by a combination of mechanical with artistic devices, the
rout of the Titans still contending with artillery of uptorn
rocks against the pursuit and thunderbolts of Jove appears
to rush downwards on the spectator. The architecture of
Giulio&rsquo;s own house in the town is also good.</p>

<p>Mantua has an academy of arts and sciences (<i>Accademia
Vergiliana</i>), occupying a fine building erected by Piermarini,
a public library founded in 1780 by Maria Theresa, a museum
of antiquities dating from 1779, many of which have been
brought from Sabbioneta, a small residence town of the Gonzagas
in the late 16th century, a mineralogical museum, a good
botanical garden, and an observatory. There are ironworks,
tanneries, breweries, oil-mills and flour-mills in the town, which
also has printing, furriery, doll-making and playing-card
industries. As a fortress Mantua was long one of the most
formidable in Europe, a force of thirty to forty thousand men
finding accommodation within its walls; but it had two serious
defects&mdash;the marshy climate told heavily on the health of
the garrison, and effective sorties were almost impossible.
It lies on the main line of railway between Verona and Modena;
and is also connected by rail with Cremona and with Monselice,
on the line from Padua to Bologna, and by steam tramway
with Brescia and other places.</p>

<p>S. Maria delle Grazie, standing some 5 m. outside the town,
was consecrated in 1399 as an act of thanksgiving for the cessation
of the plague, and has a curious collection of <i>ex voto</i> pictures
(wax figures), and also the tombs of the Gonzaga family.</p>

<p>Mantua had still a strong Etruscan element in its population
during the Roman period. It became a Roman municipium,
with the rest of Gallia Transpadana; but Martial calls it little
Mantua, and had it not been for Virgil&rsquo;s interest in his native
place, and in the expulsion of a number of the Mantuans (and
among them the poet himself) from their lands in favour of
Octavian&rsquo;s soldiers, we should probably have heard almost
nothing of its existence. In 568 the Lombards found Mantua
a walled town of some strength; recovered from their grasp
in 590 by the exarch of Ravenna, it was again captured by
Agilulf in 601. The 9th century was the period of episcopal
supremacy, and in the 11th the city formed part of the vast
possessions of Bonifacio, marquis of Canossa. From him
it passed to Geoffrey, duke of Lorraine, and afterwards to the
countess Matilda, whose support of the pope led to the conquest
of Mantua by the emperor Henry IV. in 1090. Reduced
to obedience by Matilda in 1113, the city obtained its liberty
on her death, and instituted a communal government of its
own, <i>salva imperiali justitia</i>. It afterwards joined the Lombard
League; and the unsuccessful attack made by Frederick II.
in 1236 brought it a confirmation of its privileges. But after
a period of internal discord Ludovico Gonzaga attained to
power (1328), and was recognized as imperial vicar (1329);
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page608" id="page608"></a>608</span>
and from that time till the death of Ferdinando Carbo in 1708
the Gonzagas were masters of Mantua (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Gonzaga</a></span>). Under
Gian Francesco II., the first marquis, Ludovico III., Gian
Francesco III. (whose wife was Isabella d&rsquo;Este), and Federico
II., the first duke of Mantua, the city rose rapidly into importance
as a seat of industry and culture. It was stormed and
sacked by the Austrians in 1630, and never quite recovered.
Claimed in 1708 as a fief of the empire by Joseph I., it was
governed for the greater part of the century by the Austrians.
In June 1796 it was besieged by Napoleon; but in spite of
terrific bombardments it held out till February 1797. A three
days&rsquo; bombardment in 1799 again placed Mantua in the hands of
the Austrians; and, though restored to the French by the peace
of Lunéville (1801), it became Austrian once more from 1814
till 1866. Between 1849 and 1859, when the whole of Lombardy
except Mantua was, by the peace of Villafranca, ceded to Italy,
the city was the scene of violent political persecution.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MANUAL,<a name="ar163" id="ar163"></a></span> <i>i.e.</i> belonging to the hand (Lat. <i>manus</i>), a word
chiefly used to describe an occupation which employs the hands,
as opposed to that which chiefly or entirely employs the mind.
Particular uses of the word are: &ldquo;sign-manual,&rdquo; a signature
or autograph, especially one affixed to a state document;
&ldquo;manual-exercise,&rdquo; in military usage, drill in the handling
of the rifle; &ldquo;manual alphabet,&rdquo; the formation of the letters
of the alphabet by the fingers of one or both hands for communication
with the deaf and dumb; and &ldquo;manual acts,&rdquo;
the breaking of the bread, and the taking of the cup in the
hands by the officiating priest in consecrating the elements
during the celebration of the Eucharist. The use of the word
for tools and implements to be used by the hand, as distinct
from machinery, only survives in the &ldquo;manual fire-engine.&rdquo;
From the late Latin use of <i>manuale</i> as a substantive, meaning
&ldquo;handbook,&rdquo; comes the use of the word for a book treating
a subject in a concise way, but more particularly of a book
of offices, containing the forms to be used in the administration
of the sacraments other than the Mass, but including communion
out of the Mass, also the forms for churching, burials,
&amp;c. In the Roman Church such a book is usually called a
<i>rituale</i>, &ldquo;manual&rdquo; being the name given to it in the English
Church before the Reformation. The keyboard of an organ,
as played by the hands, is called the &ldquo;manual,&rdquo; in distinction
from the &ldquo;pedal&rdquo; keys played by the feet.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MANUCODE,<a name="ar164" id="ar164"></a></span> from the French, an abbreviation of <i>Manucodiata</i>,
and the Latinized form of the Malay <i>Manukdewata</i>,
meaning, says Crawfurd (<i>Malay and Engl. Dictionary</i>, p. 97),
the &ldquo;bird of the gods,&rdquo; and a name applied for more than
two hundred years apparently to birds-of-paradise in general.
In the original sense of its inventor, Montbeillard (<i>Hist. nat.
oiseaux</i>, iii. 163), <i>Manucode</i> was restricted to the king bird-of-paradise
and three allied species; but in English it has
curiously been transferred<a name="fa1u" id="fa1u" href="#ft1u"><span class="sp">1</span></a> to a small group of species whose
relationship to the <i>Paradiseidae</i> has been frequently doubted,
and must be considered uncertain. These manucodes have
a glossy steel-blue plumage of much beauty, but are distinguished
from other birds of similar coloration by the outer and middle
toes being united for some distance, and by the extraordinary
convolution of the trachea, in the males at least, with which
is correlated the loud and clear voice of the birds. The convoluted
portion of the trachea lies on the breast, between the
skin and the muscles, much as is found in the females of the
painted snipes (<i>Rostratula</i>), in the males of the curassows
(<i>Cracidae</i>), and in a few other birds, but wholly unknown
elsewhere among the <i>Passeres</i>. The manucodes are peculiar
to the Papuan sub-region (including therein the peninsula
of Cape York), and comprehend, according to R. B. Sharpe
(<i>Cat. B. Brit. Museum</i>, iii. 164), two genera, for the first
of which, distinguished by the elongated tufts on the head,
he adopts R. P. Lesson&rsquo;s name <i>Phonygama</i>, and for the second,
having no tufts, but the feathers of the head crisped, that
of <i>Manucodia</i>; and W. A. Forbes (<i>Proc. Zool. Soc.</i> 1882,
p. 349) observed that the validity of the separation was confirmed
by their tracheal formation. Of <i>Phonygama</i> Sharpe
recognizes three species, <i>P. keraudreni</i> (the type) and <i>P. jamesi</i>,
both from New Guinea, and <i>P. gouldi</i>, the Australian representative
species; but the first two are considered by D. G.
Elliot (<i>Ibis.</i> 1878, p. 56) and Count Salvadori (<i>Ornitol. della
Papuasia</i>, ii. 510) to be inseparable. There is a greater
unanimity in regard to the species of the so-called genus <i>Manucodia</i>
proper, of which four are admitted&mdash;<i>M. chalybeata</i> or
<i>chalybea</i> from north-western New Guinea, <i>M. comriei</i> from
the south-eastern part of the same country, <i>M. atra</i> of wide
distribution within the Papuan area, and <i>M. jobiensis</i> peculiar
to the island which gives it a name. Little is known of the
habits of these birds, except that they are, as already mentioned,
remarkable for their vocal powers, which, in <i>P. keraudreni</i>, Lesson
describes (<i>Voy. de la Coquille</i>, &ldquo;Zoologie,&rdquo; i. 638) as enabling
them to pass through every note of the gamut.</p>

<hr class="foot" /> <div class="note">

<p><a name="ft1u" id="ft1u" href="#fa1u"><span class="fn">1</span></a> <i>Manucodiata</i> was used by M. J. Brisson (<i>Ornithologie</i>, ii. 130)
as a generic term equivalent to the Linnaean <i>Paradisea</i>. In 1783
Boddaert, when assigning scientific names to the birds figured by
Daubenton, called the subject of one of them (<i>Pl. enlum.</i> 634)
<i>Manucodia chalybea</i>, the first word being apparently an accidental
curtailment of the name of Brisson&rsquo;s genus to which he referred it.
Nevertheless some writers have taken it as evidence of an intention
to found a new genus by that name, and hence the importation of
<i>Manucodia</i> into scientific nomenclature, and the English form to
correspond.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MANUEL I., COMNENUS<a name="ar165" id="ar165"></a></span> (<i>c.</i> 1120-1180), Byzantine emperor
(1143-1180), the fourth son of John II., was born about 1120.
Having distinguished himself in his father&rsquo;s Turkish war,
he was nominated emperor in preference to his elder surviving
brother. Endowed with a fine physique and great personal
courage, he devoted himself whole-heartedly to a military
career. He endeavoured to restore by force of arms the predominance
of the Byzantine empire in the Mediterranean
countries, and so was involved in conflict with his neighbours
on all sides. In 1144 he brought back Raymond of Antioch
to his allegiance, and in the following year drove the Turks
out of Isauria. In 1147 he granted a passage through his
dominions to two armies of crusaders under Conrad III. of
Germany and Louis VII. of France; but the numerous outbreaks
of overt or secret hostility between the Franks and
the Greeks on their line of march, for which both sides were
to blame, nearly precipitated a conflict between Manuel and
his guests. In the same year the emperor made war upon
Roger of Sicily, whose fleet captured Corfu and plundered
the Greek towns, but in 1148 was defeated with the help of
the Venetians. In 1149 Manuel recovered Corfu and prepared
to take the offensive against the Normans. With an army
mainly composed of mercenary Italians he invaded Sicily and
Apulia, and although the progress of both these expeditions
was arrested by defeats on land and sea, Manuel maintained
a foothold in southern Italy, which was secured to him by a
peace in 1155, and continued to interfere in Italian politics.
In his endeavour to weaken the control of Venice over the
trade of his empire he made treaties with Pisa and Genoa;
to check the aspirations of Frederic I. of Germany he supported
the free Italian cities with his gold and negotiated with pope
Alexander III. In spite of his friendliness towards the Roman
church Manuel was refused the title of &ldquo;Augustus&rdquo; by Alexander,
and he nowhere succeeded in attaching the Italians
permanently to his interests. None the less in a war with the
Venetians (1172-74), he not only held his ground in Italy but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page609" id="page609"></a>609</span>
drove his enemies out of the Aegean Sea. On his northern
frontier Manuel reduced the rebellious Serbs to vassalage
(1150-52) and made repeated attacks upon the Hungarians
with a view to annexing their territory along the Save. In
the wars of 1151-53 and 1163-68 he led his troops into Hungary
but failed to maintain himself there; in 1168, however, a decisive
victory near Semlin enabled him to conclude a peace by which
Dalmatia and other frontier strips were ceded to him. In
1169 he sent a joint expedition with King Amalric of Jerusalem
to Egypt, which retired after an ineffectual attempt to capture
Damietta. In 1158-59 he fought with success against Raymond
of Antioch and the Turks of Iconium, but in later wars against
the latter he made no headway. In 1176 he was decisively
beaten by them in the pass of Myriokephalon, where he allowed
himself to be surprised in line of march. This disaster, though
partly retrieved in the campaign of the following year, had
a serious effect upon his vitality; henceforth he declined in
health and in 1180 succumbed to a slow fever.</p>

<p>In spite of his military prowess Manuel achieved but in a
slight degree his object of restoring the East Roman empire.
His victories were counterbalanced by numerous defeats,
sustained by his subordinates, and his lack of statesmanlike
talent prevented his securing the loyalty of his subjects. The
expense of keeping up his mercenary establishment and the
sumptuous magnificence of his court put a severe strain upon
the financial resources of the state. The subsequent rapid
collapse of the Byzantine empire was largely due to his brilliant
but unproductive reign. Manuel married, firstly, a sister-in-law
of Conrad III. of Germany; and secondly, a daughter
of Raymond of Antioch. His successor, Alexis II., was a son
of the latter.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MANUEL II. PALAEOLOGUS<a name="ar166" id="ar166"></a></span> (1350-1425), Byzantine emperor
from 1391 to 1425, was born in 1350. At the time of his
father&rsquo;s death he was a hostage at the court of Bayezid at
Brusa, but succeeded in making his escape; he was forthwith
besieged in Constantinople by the sultan, whose victory over the
Christians at Nicopolis, however (Sept. 28, 1396), did not secure
for him the capital. Manuel subsequently set out in person
to seek help from the West, and for this purpose visited Italy,
France, Germany and England, but without material success;
the victory of Timur in 1402, and the death of Bayezid in the
following year were the first events to give him a genuine respite
from Ottoman oppression. He stood on friendly terms with
Mahommed I., but was again besieged in his capital by Murad II.
in 1422. Shortly before his death he was forced to sign an
agreement whereby the Byzantine empire undertook to pay
tribute to the sultan.</p>

seventeen years old he entered the army, which he left in 1797
to become a lawyer. In 1814 he was chosen a member of the
chamber of representatives, and in 1815 he urged the claim of
Napoleon&rsquo;s son to the French throne and protested against the
restoration of the Bourbons. After this event be actively
opposed the government, his eloquence making him the foremost
orator among the members of the Left. In February 1823 his
opposition to the proposed expedition into Spain to help
Ferdinand VII. against his rebellious subjects produced a tumult

<p><span class="bold">MANUEL, LOUIS PIERRE<a name="ar170" id="ar170"></a></span> (1751-1793), French writer and
Revolutionist, was born at Montargis (Loiret). He entered the
Congregation of the Christian Doctrine, and became tutor to
the son of a Paris banker. In 1783 he published a pamphlet,
called <i>Essais historiques, critiques, littéraires, et philosophiques</i>,
for which he was imprisoned in the Bastille. He embraced the
revolutionary ideas, and after the taking of the Bastille became
a member of the provisional municipality of Paris. He was one
of the leaders of the <i>émeutes</i> of the 20th of June and the 10th of
August 1792, played an important part in the formation of the
revolutionary commune which assured the success of the latter
<i>coup</i>, and was made <i>procureur</i> of the commune. He was
present at the September massacres and saved several prisoners,
and on the 7th of September 1792 was elected one of the deputies
from Paris to the convention, where he was one of the promoters
of the proclamation of the republic. He suppressed the decoration
of the Cross of St Louis, which he called a stain on a man&rsquo;s
coat, and demanded the sale of the palace of Versailles. His
missions to the king, however, changed his sentiments; he became
reconciled to Louis, courageously refused to vote for the
death of the sovereign, and had to tender his resignation as

<p><span class="bold">MANUEL DE MELLO, DOM FRANCISCO<a name="ar171" id="ar171"></a></span> (? 1611-1666),
Portuguese writer, a connexion on his father&rsquo;s side of the royal
house of Braganza, was a native of Lisbon. He studied the
Humanities at the Jesuit College of S. Antão, where he showed
a precocious talent, and tradition says that at the age of fourteen
he composed a poem in <i>ottava rima</i> to celebrate the recovery of
Bahia from the Dutch, while at seventeen he wrote a scientific
work, <i>Concordancias mathematicas</i>. The death of his father,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page610" id="page610"></a>610</span>
Dom Luiz de Mello, drove him early to soldiering, and having
joined a contingent for the Flanders war, he found himself in
the historic storm of January 1627, when the pick of the Portuguese
fleet suffered shipwreck in the Bay of Biscay. He spent
much of the next ten years of his life in military routine work
in the Peninsula, varied by visits to the court of Madrid, where
he contracted a friendship with the Spanish poet Quevedo and
earned the favour of the powerful minister Olivares. In 1637
the latter despatched him in company with the conde de
Linhares on a mission to pacify the revolted city of Evora, and
on the same occasion the duke of Braganza, afterwards King
John IV. (for whom he acted as confidential agent at Madrid),
employed him to satisfy King Philip of his loyalty to the Spanish
crown. In the following year he suffered a short imprisonment
in Lisbon. In 1639 he was appointed colonel of one of the regiments
raised for service in Flanders, and in June that year he
took a leading part in defending Corunna against a French fleet
commanded by the archbishop of Bordeaux, while in the
following August he directed the embarcation of an expeditionary
force of 10,000 men when Admiral Oquendo sailed with seventy
ships to meet the French and Dutch. He came safely through
the naval defeat in the channel suffered by the Spaniards at the
hands of Van Tromp, and on the outbreak of the Catalonian
rebellion became chief of the staff to the commander-in-chief
of the royal forces, and was selected to write an account of the
campaign, the <i>Historia de la guerra de Cataluña,</i> which became a
Spanish classic. On the proclamation of Portuguese independence
in 1640 he was imprisoned by order of Olivares, and when
released hastened to offer his sword to John IV. He travelled
to England, where he spent some time at the court of Charles I.,
and thence passing over to Holland assisted the Portuguese
ambassador to equip a fleet in aid of Portugal, and himself
brought it safely to Lisbon in October 1641. For the next three
years he was employed in various important military commissions
and further busied himself in defending by his pen the king&rsquo;s
title to his newly acquired throne. An intrigue with the beautiful
countess of Villa Nova, and her husband&rsquo;s jealousy, led to
his arrest on the 19th of November 1644 on a false charge of
assassination, and he lay in prison about nine years. Though
his innocence was clear, the court of his Order, that of Christ,
influenced by his enemies, deprived him of his <i>commenda</i> and
sentenced him to perpetual banishment in India with a heavy
money fine, and the king would not intervene to save him.
Owing perhaps to the intercession of the queen regent of France
and other powerful friends, his sentence was finally commuted
into one of exile to Brazil. During his long imprisonment he
finished and printed his history of the Catalonian War, and also
wrote and published a volume of Spanish verses and some
religious treatises, and composed in Portuguese a volume of
homely philosophy, the <i>Carta de Guia de Casados</i> and a <i>Memorial</i>
in his own defence to the king, which Herculano considered
&ldquo;perhaps the most eloquent piece of reasoning in the language.&rdquo;
During his exile in Brazil, whither he sailed on the 17th of April
1655, he lived at Bahia, where he wrote one of his <i>Epanaphoras
de varia historia</i> and two parts of his masterpiece, the <i>Apologos
dialogaes</i>. He returned home in 1659, and from then until
1663 we find him on and off in Lisbon, frequenting the celebrated
<i>Academia dos Generosos</i>, of which he was five times elected
president. In the last year he proceeded to Parma and Rome, by
way of England, and France, and Alphonso VI. charged him to
negotiate with the Curia about the provision of bishops for Portuguese
sees and to report on suitable marriages for the king and
his brother. During his stay in Rome he published his <i>Obras
morales</i>, dedicated to Queen Catherine, wife of Charles II. of
England, and his <i>Cartas familiares</i>. On his way back to
Portugal he printed his <i>Obras metricas</i> at Lyons in May 1665,
and he died in Lisbon the following year.</p>

<p>Manuel de Mello&rsquo;s early Spanish verses are tainted with
Gongorism, but his Portuguese sonnets and <i>cartas</i> on moral
subjects are notable for their power, sincerity and perfection
of form. He strove successfully to emancipate himself from
foreign faults of style, and by virtue of his native genius, and his
knowledge of the traditional poetry of the people, and the best
Quinhentista models, he became Portugal&rsquo;s leading lyric poet
and prose writer of the 17th century. As with Camoens, imprisonments
and exile contributed to make Manuel de Mello a
great writer. His <i>Letters</i>, addressed to the leading nobles,
ecclesiastics, diplomats and literati of the time, are written in a

<p><span class="bold">MANURES<a name="ar173" id="ar173"></a></span> <span class="sc">and</span> <span class="bold">MANURING.</span> The term &ldquo;manure&rdquo; originally
meant that which was &ldquo;worked by hand&rdquo; (Fr. <i>man&oelig;uvre</i>),
but gradually came to apply to any process by which the soil
could be improved. Prominent among such processes was that
of directly applying &ldquo;manure&rdquo; to the land, manure in this sense
being what we now call &ldquo;farmyard manure&rdquo; or &ldquo;dung,&rdquo; the
excreta of farm animals mixed with straw or other litter. Gradually,
however, the use of the term spread to other materials,
some of home origin, some imported, some manufactured by
artificial processes, but all useful as a means of improving the
fertility of the soil. Hence we have two main classes of manures:
(<i>a</i>) what may be termed &ldquo;natural manures,&rdquo; and (<i>b</i>) &ldquo;artificial
manures.&rdquo; Manures, again, may be divided according to the
materials from which they are made&mdash;<i>e.g.</i> &ldquo;bone manure,&rdquo; &ldquo;fish
manure,&rdquo; &ldquo;wool manure,&rdquo; &amp;c.; or according to the constituents
which they mainly supply&mdash;<i>e.g.</i> &ldquo;phosphatic manures,&rdquo; &ldquo;potash
manures,&rdquo; &ldquo;nitrogenous manures,&rdquo; or there may be numerous
combinations of these to form mixed or &ldquo;compound&rdquo; manures.
Whatever it be, the word &ldquo;manure&rdquo; is now generally applied to
anything which is used for fertilizing the soil. In America the
term &ldquo;fertilizers&rdquo; is more generally adopted, and in Great
Britain the introduction of the &ldquo;Fertilizers and Feeding Stuffs
Act&rdquo; has effected a certain amount of change in the same
direction. The modern tendency to turn attention less to the
consideration of manurial applications given to land and more
to the physical and mechanical changes introduced thereby in
the soil itself, would seem to be carrying the word &ldquo;manure&rdquo;
back more to its original meaning.</p>

<p>The subject of manures and their application involves a prior
consideration of plant life and its requirements. The plant,
growing in the soil, and surrounded by the atmosphere, derives
from these two sources its nourishment and means of growth
through the various stages of its development.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Chemical analysis has shown that plants are composed of water,
organic or combustible matters, and inorganic or mineral matters.
Water constitutes by far the greater part of a living plant; a grass
crop will contain about 75% of water, a turnip crop 89 or 90%.
The organic or combustible matters are those which are lost, along
with the water, when the plant is burnt; the inorganic or mineral
matters are those which are left behind as an &ldquo;ash&rdquo; after the burning.
The combustible matter is composed of six elements: carbon,
hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur and a little phosphorus. About
one-half of the combustible matter of plants is carbon. Along with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page611" id="page611"></a>611</span>
hydrogen and oxygen the carbon forms the cellulose, starch, sugar,
&amp;c., which plants contain, and with these same elements and sulphur
the carbon forms the albuminoids of plants. The inorganic or mineral
matters comprise a comparatively small part of the plant, but they
contain, as essential constituents of plant life, the following elements:
potassium, calcium, magnesium, iron, phosphorus and sulphur.
In addition, other, but not essential, elements are found in the ash
<i>e.g.</i> sodium, silicon and chlorine, together with small quantities of
manganese and other rarer elements.</p>

<p>The above constituents that have been classed as &ldquo;essential,&rdquo;
are necessary for the growth of the plant, and absence of any one will
involve failure. This has been shown by growing plants in water
dissolved in which are salts of the elements present in plants. By
omitting in turn one or other of the elements aforesaid it is found
that the plants will not grow after they have used up the materials
contained in the seed itself. These elements are accordingly termed
&ldquo;essential,&rdquo; and it therefore becomes necessary to inquire how
they are to be supplied.</p>

<p>The atmosphere is the great storehouse of organic plant food.
The leaves take up, through their stomata, the carbonic acid and
other gases of the atmosphere. The carbonic acid, under the influence
of light, is decomposed in the chlorophyll cells, oxygen is
given off and carbon is assimilated, being subsequently built up into
the various organic bodies forming the plant&rsquo;s structure. It would
seem, too, that plants can take up a small quantity of ammonia
by their leaves, and also water to some extent, but the free or uncombined
nitrogen of the air cannot be directly assimilated by the
leaves of plants.</p>

<p>From the soil, on the other hand, the plant obtains, by means of
its roots, its mineral requirements, also sulphur and phosphorus,
and nearly all its nitrogen and water. Carbon, too, in the case of
fungi, is obtained from the decayed vegetable matter in the soil.
The roots are able not only to take up soluble salts that are presented
to them, but they can attack and render soluble the solid constituents
of the soil, thus transforming them into available plant food.
In this way important substances, such as phosphoric acid and potash,
are supplied to the plant, as also lime. Roots can further supply
themselves with nitrogen in the form of nitrates, the ammonia
and other nitrogenous bodies undergoing ready conversion into
nitrates in the soil. These various mineral constituents, being now
transferred to the plant, go to form new tissue, and ultimately
seed, or else accumulate in the sap and are deposited on the older
tissue.</p>

<p>Whether the nitrogen of the air can be utilized by plants or not
has been long and strenuously discussed, Boussingault first, and then
Lawes, Gilbert and Pugh, maintaining that there was no evidence
of this utilization. But it was always recognized that certain plants,
clover for example, enriched the land with nitrogen to an extent
greater than could be accounted for by the mere supply to them of
nitrates in the soil. Ultimately Hellriegel supplied the explanation
by showing that, at all events, certain of the Leguminosae, by the
medium of swellings or &ldquo;nodules&rdquo; on their roots, were able to fix
the atmospheric nitrogen in the soil, and to convert it into nitrates
for the use of the plant. This was found to be the result of the action
of certain organisms within the nodules themselves, which in turn
fed upon the carbohydrates of the plant and were thus living in a
state of &ldquo;symbiosis&rdquo; with it. So far, however, this has not been
shown to be the case with any other plants than the Leguminosae,
and, though it is asserted by some that many other plants can take up
the nitrogen of the air directly through their leaves, there is no clear
evidence as yet of this.</p>
</div>

<p>We must now consider how the different requirements of the
plant in regard to the elements necessary to maintain its life
and to build up its structure affect the question of manuring.</p>

<p>Under conditions of natural growth and decay, when no
crops are gathered in, or consumed on the land by live stock,
the herbage, on dying down and decaying, returns to the atmosphere
and the soil the elements taken from them during life;
but, under cultivation, a succession of crops deprives the land
of the constituents which are essential to healthy and luxuriant
growth. Without an adequate return to the land of the matters
removed in the produce, its fertility cannot be maintained for
many years. In newly opened countries, where old forests
have been cleared and the land brought under cultivation, the
virgin soil often possesses at first a high degree of fertility, but
gradually its productive power decreases from year to year.
Where land is plentiful and easy to be obtained it is more convenient
to clear fresh forest land than to improve more or less
exhausted land by the application of manure, labour and skill.
But in all densely peopled countries, and where the former mode
of cultivation cannot be followed, it is necessary to resort to
artificial means to restore the natural fertility of the land and to
maintain and increase its productiveness. That continuous
cropping without return of manure ends in deterioration of the
soil is well seen in the case of the wheat-growing areas in America.
Crops of wheat were taken one after another, the straw was
burned and nothing was returned to the land; the produce began
to fall off and the cultivators moved on to fresh lands, there to
meet, in time, with the same experience; and now that the available
land has been more or less intensely occupied, or that new
land is too far removed for ready transport of the produce, it has
been found necessary to introduce the system of manuring, and
America now manufactures and uses for herself large quantities
of artificial and other manures.</p>

<p>That the same exhaustion of soil would go on in Great Britain,
if unchecked by manuring, is known to every practical farmer,
and, if evidence were needed, it is supplied by the renowned
Rothamsted experiments of Lawes and Gilbert, on a heavy
land, and also by the more recent Woburn experiments of the
Royal Agricultural Society of England, conducted on a light
sandy soil. The following table will illustrate this point, and
show also how under a system of manuring the fertility is maintained:&mdash;</p>

<p>Whereas on the heavier and richer land of Rothamsted the
produce of unmanured wheat has fallen in 58 years from 17.2
bushels to 12.3 bushels, on the lighter and poorer soil of Woburn
it has fallen in 30 years from 17.4 bushels to 10.8 bushels; barley
has in 50 years at Rothamsted gone from 22.4 bushels to 10
bushels, whilst at Woburn (which is better suited for barley)
it has fallen in 30 years from 23 bushels to 13.3 bushels. At both
Rothamsted and Woburn the application of farm-yard manure
has kept the produce of wheat and barley practically up to what
it was at the beginning, or even increased it. Similar conclusions
can be drawn from the use of artificial manures at each of
the experimental stations named, exemplifying the fact that
with suitable manuring crops of wheat or barley can be grown
years after year without the land undergoing deterioration,
whereas if left unmanured it gradually declines in fertility.
Practical proof has further been given of this in the well-known
&ldquo;continuous corn-growing&rdquo; system pursued, in his regular
farming, by Mr John Prout of Sawbridgeworth, Herts, and subsequently
by his son, Mr W. A. Prout, since the year 1862. By
supplying, in the form of artificial manures, the necessary constituents
for his crops, Mr Prout was enabled to grow year after
year, with only an occasional interval for a clover crop and to
allow of cleaning the land, excellent crops of wheat, barley and
oats, and without, it may be added, the use of farm-yard manure
at all.</p>

<p>In considering the economical use of manures on the land
regard must be had to the following points: (1) the requirements
of the crops intended to be cultivated; (2) the physical
condition of the soil; (3) the chemical composition of the soil; and
(4) the composition of the manure. Briefly stated, the guiding
principle of manuring economically and profitably is to meet
the requirements of the crops intended to be cultivated, by incorporating
with the soil, in the most efficacious states of combination,
the materials in which it is deficient, or which the various
crops usually grown on the farm do not find in the land in a
sufficiently available condition to ensure an abundant harvest.
Soils vary greatly in composition, and hence it will be readily
understood that in one locality or on one particular field a certain
manure may be used with great benefit, while in another field
the same manure has little or no effect upon the produce.</p>

<p>For plant life to thrive certain elements are necessary, viz.
carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur, phosphorus, among
the organic or combustible matters, and among the inorganic
or mineral matters, potassium, calcium, magnesium, iron, phosphorus
and sulphur. We must now examine the extent to which
these necessary elements occur in either of the two great storehouses,
the atmosphere and the soil, and how their removal in
the form of crops may be made up for by the use of manures, so
that the soil may be maintained in a state of fertility. Further,
we must consider what functions these elements perform in
regard to plant life, and, lastly, the forms in which they can best
be applied for the use of crops.</p>

<p>Of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen there is no lack, the atmosphere
providing carbonic acid in abundance, and rain giving
the elements hydrogen and oxygen, so that these are supplied
from natural sources. Iron, magnesium and sulphur also are
seldom or never deficient in soils, and do not require to be
supplemented by manuring. Accordingly, the elements for which
there is the greatest demand by plants, and which the soil does
not provide in sufficiency, are nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium,
and, possibly, calcium. Manuring, apart from the physical and
mechanical advantages which it confers upon soils, practically
resolves itself, therefore, into the supply of nitrogen, phosphorus
and potassium, and it is with the supply of these that we shall
accordingly deal in particular.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>1. <i>Nitrogen.</i>&mdash;Though we are still far from knowing what are
the exact functions which nitrogen fulfils in plant life, there is no
doubt as to the important part which it plays in the vegetable
growth of the plant and in the formation of stem and leaf. Without
a sufficiency of nitrogen the plant would be stunted in growth.
Its growth, indeed, may be said to be measured by the supply of
nitrogen, for while mineral constituents like phosphoric acid and
potash are only taken up to the extent that the plant can use them
<i>i.e.</i> according to its rate of growth, this actual growth itself would
seem to be determined by the extent of the nitrogen supply. This
it is which causes the ready response given to a crop by the application
of some quickly-acting nitrogenous material like nitrate of soda,
and which is marked by the dark-green colour produced and the
pushing-on of the growth. Similarly, this use of nitrogen, by prolonging
growth, defers maturity, while over-use of nitrogen tends
to produce increase of leaf and lateness of ripening. Along with this
growth of the vegetative portions, and seen, in the case of corn crops,
mainly in the straw, there is a corresponding decrease, from the use
of nitrogen in excess, in the quality of the grain. In corn a smaller
grain and lesser weight per bushel are the result of over-nitrogen
manuring. The composition of the grain is likewise affected, becoming
more nitrogenous. With crops, however, where rapid green
growth is required, nitrogen effects the purpose well, though here,
too, over-manuring with nitrogen will tend to produce rankness and
coarseness of growth. Experiments at Rothamsted and elsewhere,
as well as everyday practice of the farm, bear testimony to the
paramount importance of nitrogen-supply, and to the crops it is
capable of raising. This applies not only to corn crops of all kinds,
but to root crops, grass, potatoes, &amp;c. Leguminous crops alone seem
to have no need of it. In view of this practical experience, Liebig&rsquo;s
&ldquo;mineral theory&rdquo;&mdash;according to which he laid down that plants
only needed to have mineral constituents, such as phosphoric acid,
potash and lime, supplied to them&mdash;reads strangely nowadays.
The use of mineral manures without nitrogen other than that already
present in the soil or supplied in rain has been shown, alike at
Rothamsted and Woburn, to produce crops of wheat and barley
little better than those from unmanured land. The lack of nitrogen
in ordinary cultivated soils is much more marked than is that of
mineral constituents, and consequently even with the application
of nitrogen alone (as by the use of nitrate of soda or sulphate of
ammonia), good crops have been grown for a large number of years.
This has been shown both at Rothamsted and at Woburn. On the
other hand, experiments at these stations have demonstrated that
better and more lasting results are obtained by the judicious use of
nitrogenous materials in conjunction with phosphates and potash.</p>

<p>The form in which nitrogen is taken up by plants is mainly, if not
wholly, that of nitrates, which are readily-soluble salts. Ammonia
and other nitrogenous bodies undergo in the soil, through the agency
of nitrifying organisms present in it (<i>Bacterium nitrificans</i>, &amp;c.),
rapid conversion into nitrates, and as such are easily assimilable
by the plant. Similarly, they are the constituents which are most
readily removed in drainage, and hence the adequate supply of nitrogen
for the plant&rsquo;s use is a constant problem in agriculture. Experiments
on the rate of removal of nitrates from the soil by drainage
showed that every inch of rain passing through the drains caused a
loss of 2½ &#8468; of nitrogen per acre (Voelcker and Frankland). At the
same time, soils, as Way showed, have the power of absorbing, in
different degrees, ammonia from its solution in water, and when
salts of ammonia are passed through soils the ammonia alone is
absorbed, the acids passing, generally in combination with lime, into
the drainage.</p>

<p>Other experiments at Rothamsted on drainage showed that,
though large quantities of ammonia salts were applied to the land,
the drainage water contained merely traces of ammonia, but, on the
other hand, nitrates in quantity, thus proving that it is as nitrates,
and not as ammonia, that plants mainly, if not entirely, take up their
nitrogenous food.</p>

<p>From these investigations it follows that much more nitrogen
must be added to the land than would be needed to produce a given
increase in the crop. Nitrogen, then, being so all-important, the question
is, where is it to come from? We have seen that the leaves take
up only minute quantities of ammonia, comparatively small amounts
are supplied in the rain, dew, snow, &amp;c.,<a name="fa1v" id="fa1v" href="#ft1v"><span class="sp">1</span></a> and in the case of Leguminosae
alone have we any evidence of plants being able to provide
themselves with nitrogen from atmospheric sources. Some few
organisms present in fertile soils, <i>e.g.</i> <i>Azotobacter chroococcum</i>, have
also the power, under certain conditions, of fixing the free nitrogen
of the atmosphere without the intervention of a &ldquo;host,&rdquo; but all these
sources would be very inadequate to meet the demands of an
intensive cultivation. An ordinary fertile arable soil will not show, on
analysis, much more than .15% of nitrogen, and it is evident that
the great source of supply of the needed nitrogen must be the direct
manuring of the soil with materials containing nitrogen. These
materials will be considered in detail later.</p>

<p>2. <i>Phosphorus.</i>&mdash;This is the most important mineral element
which has to be supplied to the soil by the agency of manuring.
It occurs in ordinary fertile soils to the extent of only about .15%,
reckoned as phosphoric acid, and though its absence in sufficiency is
not so marked or so soon shown under prolonged cultivation as is that
of nitrogen, yet the fact that it is needed by all classes of crops, and
that its application in manurial form is attended with great benefits,
makes its supply one of great importance. From the time that Liebig,
in 1840, suggested the treatment of bones with sulphuric acid in order
to make them more readily available for the use of crops, and that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page613" id="page613"></a>613</span>
the late Sir John Lawes (in 1843) began the dissolving of mineral
phosphates for the purpose of manufacturing superphosphate, the
&ldquo;artificial manure&rdquo; trade took its rise, and ever since then the whole
globe has been exploited for the purpose of obtaining the raw phosphatic
materials which form the base of the artificial manures of the
past and of the present day. The functions which phosphoric acid
fulfils in plant life would appear to be connected rather with the
maturing of the plant than with the actual growth of the structure.
Phosphates are found concentrated in those parts of the plant where
cell growth and reproduction are most active. More especially is
this the case with the seed in which phosphates are present in greatest
quantity. While nitrogen delays maturity, phosphoric acid has
just the opposite effect, and cereal crops not sufficiently supplied
with it ripen much more tardily than do others. Moreover, the grain
is formed more early when phosphatic manures have been given
than when they are withheld. Phosphates increase the proportion
of corn to straw, and, as regards the grain itself, they render it less
nitrogenous, richer in phosphates, and altogether improve its
quality.</p>

<p>While these are the principal functions of phosphates, they also
exercise an influence on the young plant in its early stages. This
is well seen in the almost universal practice of applying superphosphate
to the young turnip or swede crop in order to push it
beyond the attack of &ldquo;fly.&rdquo; Undoubtedly phosphates in readily
available form stimulate the young seedling, enabling it to develop
root growth, and, later on, causing the plant to &ldquo;tiller out&rdquo; well.
Phosphoric acid occurs in the soil bound up with the oxides of iron
and alumina, or, it may be, with lime, and the extent to which it
may become useful to plants will depend largely upon the readiness
with which it becomes available. For the purpose of ascertaining
this different analytical methods have been suggested, the best
known one being that of B. Dyer, in which a 1% solution of citric
acid is used as a solvent. As a result of experimenting with
Rothamsted soils of known capability it has been put forward that
if a soil shows, by this treatment, less than .01% of phosphoric
acid it is in need of phosphatic manuring.</p>

<p>Experiments carried on for many years at Rothamsted and
Woburn have clearly established the beneficial effects of phosphatic
manuring on corn crops, for though no material increase marks
the application of mineral manures in the absence of nitrogen, yet
the results when phosphates and nitrogen are used together are
very much greater than when nitrogen alone has been applied; and
this is true as regards not only the better ripening and quality of
the grain, but also as regards the actual crop increase.</p>

<p>With root crops phosphates are almost indispensable; and,
owing to the limited power which these crops have of utilizing
the phosphoric acid in the soil, the supply of a readily available
phosphatic manure like superphosphate is of the highest
importance.</p>

<p>The assimilation of phosphoric acid goes on in a cereal crop after
the time of flowering and to a later date than does that of nitrogen
and potash, and it is ultimately stored in the seed. Soils possess
a retentive power for phosphoric acid which enables the latter
to be conserved and not removed to any extent by drainage.
This function is exercised mainly by the presence of oxide of
iron. Alumina acts in a similar way. In the case of soils that
contain clay only traces of phosphoric acid are found in the drainage
water.</p>

<p>3. <i>Potassium.</i>&mdash;The element third in importance, which requires
to be supplied by manuring, is potassium, or, as it is generally expressed,
potash. This in its functions resembles phosphoric acid
somewhat, being concerned rather with the mature development
of the plant than with its actual increase of growth. Like phosphoric
acid, potash is found concentrated throughout the plant in
the early stages of its growth, but, unlike it, is in the case of a
cereal crop all taken up by the time of full bloom, whereas with
phosphoric acid the assimilation continues later. Potash would
appear to have an intimate connexion with the quality of crops,
and to be favourable to the production of seed and fruit rather than
to stem and leaf development. Certain crops, such as vegetables,
fruit, hops, as well as root crops generally, make special demands
upon potash supply, and, as checking the tendency to over-development
of leaf, &amp;c., induced by nitrogenous manures when used alone,
potash has great practical importance. Potash appears to be
bound up in a special way with the process of assimilation, for it
has been clearly shown that whenever potash is deficient the formation
of the carbohydrates, such as sugar, starch and cellulose, does
not go on properly. Hellriegel and Wilfarth showed by experiment
the dependence of starch formation on an adequate supply of potash.
Cereal grains remained small and undeveloped when potash was
withheld, because the formation of starch did not go on. The
same effect has been strikingly shown in the Rothamsted experiments
with mangels, a plot receiving potash salts as manure giving
a crop of roots nearly 2½ times as heavy as that grown on a plot
which has received no potash. In this case the increase is due
almost entirely to the sugar and other carbohydrates elaborated
in the leaves, and not to any increase of mineral constituents.</p>

<p>The effect of potash on maturity is somewhat uncertain, inasmuch
as in the case of grain crops it would appear to delay maturity and
to hasten it in that of root crops.</p>

<p>The influence of potash on particular crops is very marked.
On clovers and other leguminous crops it is highly beneficial, while
on grass land it is of particular importance as inducing the spread
of clovers and other leguminous herbage. This is well seen in the
Rothamsted grass experiments, where with a mineral manure
containing potash one-half of the herbage is leguminous in nature,
whereas the same manure without potash gives only 15% of leguminous
plants. Similarly, where nitrogen is used by itself and no
potash given there are no leguminous plants at all to be found.
Potash occurs in an ordinary fertile soil to the extent of about .20%;
a sandy soil will have less, a clay soil may have considerably more.
Potash, however, is mostly bound up in the soil in the form of
insoluble silicates, and these are often in a far from available form,
but require cultivation, the use of lime and other means for getting
them acted on by the air and moisture, and so liberating the potash.
According to B. Dyer&rsquo;s method of ascertaining the availability of
potash in soils, the amount of potash soluble in a 1% citric acid
solution should be about .005%, otherwise the addition of potash
manures will be a requisite. In the case of soils containing much
lime a larger quantity would, no doubt, be needed.</p>

<p>Potash, like phosphoric acid, is readily retained by soils, and so
is not subject to any considerable losses by drainage. This retention
is exercised by the ferric-oxide and alumina in soils, but still more
so by the double silicates, and to some extent also by the humus
of the soil. Potash will be liberated from its salts by the action
of lime in the soil, the lime taking the place of the potash. Lime
is, therefore, of much importance in setting free fresh stores of
potash. Soda salts also, when in considerable excess, are able to
liberate potash from its compounds, and to this is probably due, in
many cases, the beneficial action attending the use of common salt.</p>

<p>4. <i>Calcium.</i>&mdash;Though calcium, or lime, is found in sufficiency in
most cultivated soils, there are, nevertheless, soils in which lime
is clearly deficient and where that deficiency has shown itself in
practice. Moreover, so comparatively easy is the removal of lime
from the soil by drainage, and so important is the part which lime
plays in liberating potash from its compounds, and in helping to
retain bases in the soil so that they are not lost in drainage, that
the significance of lime cannot be ignored. Further, the availability
of both potash and phosphoric acid in the soil has been
found to be much increased by the presence of lime. Lime, as
carbonate of calcium, is also necessary for the process of nitrification
to go on in the soil. Some sandy soils, and even some clays, contain
so little lime as to call for the direct supply of lime as an addition
to the soil. When this is the case nothing can adequately take
the place of lime, and in this sense lime may be called a &ldquo;manure.&rdquo;
In the majority of cases, however, the practice of liming or chalking,
which was a common one in former times, was resorted to
mainly because of the ameliorating effects it produced on the land,
both in a mechanical and in a physical direction. Thus, on clay
soil it flocculates the particles, rendering the soil less tenacious of
moisture, improving the drainage and making the soil warmer.
Nor must the directly chemical results be overlooked, for in addition
to those already mentioned, of liberating plant food (chiefly potash
and phosphoric acid), retaining bases, and aiding nitrification,
lime acts in a special way as regards the sourness or &ldquo;acidity&rdquo;
which is sometimes produced in land when lime is deficient. In
soils that are acid through the accumulation of humic acid nitrification
does not go on, and bacterial life is repressed. The addition
of lime has the effect of &ldquo;sweetening&rdquo; the land, and of restoring
its bacterial activity. This acidity is also seen in the occurrence of
the disease known as &ldquo;finger and toe&rdquo; in turnips, the fungus producing
this being one that thrives in an acid soil. It is only found
in soils poor in lime, and the only remedy for it is liming. The
growth of weeds like spurry, marigold, sorrel, &amp;c., is also a sign of
land being wanting in lime. The most striking instance of this
&ldquo;soil acidity&rdquo; is that afforded by the Woburn experiments,
where, on a soil originally poor in lime, the soil has, through the
continuous use of ammonia salts, been impoverished of its lime to
such an extent that it has become quite sterile and is distinctly
acid in character. The application of lime, however, to such a soil
has had the effect of quite restoring its fertility.</p>

<p>The amount of lime which soils contain is a very variable one,
chalk soils being very rich in lime, whereas sandy and peaty soils
are generally very poor in it. If the amount of lime in a soil falls
below 1% of carbonate of lime on the dried soil, the soil will sooner
or later require liming.</p>

<p>5. <i>Magnesium.</i>&mdash;This is not known to be deficient in soils, although
an essential element in them, and it is seldom directly applied
as a manurial ingredient. Some natural potash salts, such as
kainit, contain magnesia salts in considerable quantity; but their
influence is not known to be of beneficial nature, though, like
common salt, magnesia salts will, doubtless, render some of the
potash in the soil available. At the same time magnesia salts are
not without their influence on crops, and experiments have been
undertaken at the Woburn experimental farm and elsewhere to
determine the nature of this influence. Carbonate of magnesia
has been tried in connexion with potato-growing, and, it is said,
with good results.</p>

<p>6. <i>Iron.</i>&mdash;Iron is another essential ingredient of soil that is found
in abundance and does not call for special application in manurial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page614" id="page614"></a>614</span>
form. Iron is essential for the formation of chlorophyll in the
leaves, and its presence is believed also to be beneficial for the
development of colour in flowers, and for producing flavour in
fruits and in vines especially. Ferrous sulphate has, partly with
this view, and partly for its fungus-resisting properties, been
suggested as a desirable constituent of manures. The function
performed by ferric oxide in the soil of retaining phosphoric
acid, potash and ammonia has been already alluded to.</p>

<p>7. <i>Sulphur.</i>&mdash;This, the last of the &ldquo;essential&rdquo; elements, is seldom
specially employed in manurial form. There would appear to be
no lack of it for the plant&rsquo;s supply, and it is little required except
for the building-up, with carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen,
of the albuminoids. There are few artificial manures which do not
contain considerable amounts of sulphur, notably superphosphate.
Sulphate of lime (gypsum) is sometimes applied to the land direct
as a way of giving lime; this is employed in the case of clover and
hops principally.</p>
</div>

<p>Having thus dealt with the essential ingredients which plants
must have, and which may require to be supplied to them in the
form of additional manures, we may briefly pass over the other
constituents found in plants, which may, or may not, be
given as manures.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>8. <i>Sodium.</i>&mdash;This is a widely distributed element. The influence
of common salt (chloride of sodium) in liberating, when used in
large excess, potash from the silicates in which it is combined in
the soil has been already referred to, and in this way common salt
and also nitrate of soda (the two forms in which soda salts are used
as manures) may have some benefit. The principal purpose for
which common salt, however, is used, is that of retaining moisture
in the land. It is specially useful in a dry season, or for succulent
crops such as cabbage, kale, &amp;c., or again for plants of maritime
origin (such as mangels), which thrive near the sea shore.</p>

<p>9. <i>Silicon.</i>&mdash;All soils contain silica in abundance. Though
silica forms so large a part of the ash of plants and is especially
abundant in the straw of cereals, there is no evidence that it is
required in plant life. Popularly, it is believed to &ldquo;stiffen&rdquo; the
stems of cereals and grasses, but plants grown without it will do
perfectly well. It would, however, appear that soluble silica does
play some part in enabling phosphoric acid to be better assimilated
by the plant. Silicates, however, have not justified their use as
direct fertilizers.</p>

<p>10. <i>Chlorine.</i>&mdash;A certain amount of chlorine is brought down in
the rain, and chlorides are also used in the form of common salt, with
the effect, as aforesaid, of liberating potash from silicates, when given
in excess, but there is no evidence as to any particular part which
the chlorine itself plays.</p>

<p>11. <i>Manganese</i>, &amp;c.&mdash;Manganese occurs in minute quantities in
most plants, and it, along with lithium (found largely in the tobacco-plant),
caesium, titanium, uranium and other rare elements, may
be found in soils. Experiments at the Woburn pot-culture station
and elsewhere, point to stimulating effects on vegetation produced
by the action of minute doses of salts of these elements, but, so far,
their use as manurial ingredients need not be considered in practice.</p>

<p>12. <i>Humus.</i>&mdash;Though not an element, or itself essential, this
body, which may be described as decayed vegetable matter, is not
without importance in plant life. Of it, farm-yard manure is to
a large extent composed, and many &ldquo;organic manures,&rdquo; as they
are termed, contain it in quantity. Dead leaves, decayed vegetation,
the stubble of cereal crops and many waste materials add
humus to the land, and this humus, by exposure to the air, is always
undergoing further changes in the soil, opening it out, distributing
carbonic acid through it, and supplying it, in its further decomposition,
with nitrogen. The principal effects of humus on the
soil are of a physical character, and it exercises particular benefit
through its power of retaining moisture. Humus, however, has
a distinct chemical action, in that it forms combinations with iron,
calcium and ammonia. It thus becomes one of the principal sources
of supply of the nitrogenous food of plants, and a soil rich in humus
is one rich in nitrogen. The nitrogen in humus is not directly
available as a food for plants, but many kinds of fungi and bacteria
are capable of converting it into ammonia, from which, by the
agency of nitrifying organisms, it is turned into nitrates and made
available for the use of plants. Humus is able to retain phosphoric
acid, potash, ammonia and other bases. So important were the
functions of humus considered at one time that on this Thaer built
his &ldquo;humus theory,&rdquo; which was, in effect, that, if humus was
supplied to the soil, plants required nothing more. This was based,
however, on the erroneous belief that the carbon, of which the bulk
of the plant consists, was derived from the humus of the soil, and
not, as we now know it to be, from the carbonic acid of the
atmosphere. This theory was in turn replaced by the &ldquo;mineral
theory&rdquo; of Liebig, and then both of them by the &ldquo;nitrogen theory&rdquo;
of Lawes and Gilbert.</p>
</div>

<p>We pass next to review, in the light of the foregoing, the
manures in common use at the present day.</p>

<p>Manures, as already stated, may be variously classified
according to the materials they are made from, the constituents
which they chiefly supply, or the uses to which they are put.
But, except with certain few manures, such as nitrate of soda,
sulphate of ammonia and potash salts, which are used purely for
one particular purpose, it is impossible to make any definite
classification of manures, owing to the fact that the majority of
them serve more than one purpose, and contain more than one
fertilizing constituent of value. It is only on broad lines, therefore,
that any division can be framed. Between so-called
&ldquo;natural&rdquo; manures like farm-yard manure, seaweed, wool
waste, shoddy, bones, &amp;c., which undergo no particular artificial
preparation, and manufactured manures like superphosphate,
dissolved bones, and other artificially prepared materials, there
may, however, be a distinction drawn, as also between these
and such materials as are imported and used without further
preparation, <i>e.g.</i> nitrate of soda, kainit, &amp;c. On the whole, the
best classification to attempt is that according to the fertilizing
constituents which each principally supplies, and this will be
adopted here, with the necessary qualifications.</p>

<p class="pt1 center"><span class="sc">I.&mdash;Nitrogenous (wholly or mainly) Manures</span></p>

<p>These divided themselves into: (<i>a</i>) Natural nitrogenous
manures; (<i>b</i>) imported or manufactured manures.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p class="pt1 center"><i>a.</i> <span class="sc">Natural Nitrogenous Manures</span></p>

<p>Under this heading come&mdash;farm-yard manure; seaweed; refuse
cakes and meals; wool dust and shoddy; hoofs and horns; blood;
soot; sewage sludge.</p>

<p><i>Farm-yard Manure.</i>&mdash;This is the most important, as well as the
most generally used, of all natural manures. It consists of the
solid and liquid excreta of animals that are fed at the homestead,
together with the material used as litter. The composition of
farm-yard manure will vary greatly according to the conditions
under which it is produced. The principal determining factors
are (1) the nature and age of the animals producing it, (2) the food
that is given them, (3) the kind and quantity of litter used, (4)
whether it be made in feeding-boxes, covered yards or open yards,
(5) the length of time and the way in which it has been stored.
The following analysis represents the general composition of well-made
farm-yard manure, in which the litter used is straw:&mdash;</p>

</table>

<p class="noind">Put broadly, farm-yard manure will contain from 65 to 80% of
water, from .45 to .65% of nitrogen, from .4 to .8% of potash, and
from .2 to .5% of phosphoric acid.</p>

<p>This analysis shows that farm-yard manure contains all the
constituents, without exception, which are required by cultivated
crops in order to bring them to perfection, and hence it may be called
a &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; manure. Dung, it may be observed, contains a great
variety of organic and inorganic compounds of various degrees of
solubility, and this complexity of composition&mdash;difficult, if not
impossible, to imitate by art&mdash;is one of the circumstances which
render farm-yard manure a perfect as well as a universal manure.</p>

<p>The excrements of different kinds of animals vary in composition,
and those of the same animal will vary according to the nature and
quantity of the food given, the age of the animal, and the way it
is generally treated. Thus, a young animal which is growing,
needs food to produce bone and muscle, and voids poorer dung than
one which is fully grown and only has to keep up its condition.
Similarly, a milking-cow will produce poorer dung than a fattening
bullock. Again, cake-feeding will produce a richer manure than
feeding without cake. Straw is the most general litter used, but
peat-moss litter, sawdust, &amp;c., may be used, and they will affect
the quality of the manure to some extent. Peat-moss is the best
absorbent and has a higher manurial value than straw. Box-fed
manure, and that made in covered yards will suffer much less loss
than that made in an open yard. Lastly, manure kept in a heap
covered with earth will be much richer than that left in an uncovered
heap. The solid and liquid excrements differ much in composition,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page615" id="page615"></a>615</span>
for, while the former contain principally phosphoric acid, lime,
magnesia, and silica and comparatively little nitrogen, the urine
is almost destitute of phosphoric acid, and abounds in alkaline salts
(including salts of potash) and in nitrogenous organic matters,
among which are urea and uric acid, and which on decomposition
yield ammonia. Unless, therefore, the two kinds of excrements
are mixed, a perfect manure supplying all the needs of the plant is
not obtained; care must accordingly be taken to absorb all the urine
by the litter. Farm-yard manure, it is well known, is much affected
by the length of time and the way in which it has been kept. Fresh
dung is soluble in water only to a limited extent, and, in consequence,
it acts more slowly on vegetation, and the action lasts longer than
when dung is used which has been kept some time; fresh dung is
therefore generally used in autumn or winter, and thoroughly rotten
dung in spring, when an immediate forcing effect is required.</p>

<p>The changes which farm-yard manure undergoes on keeping, have
been made the subject of much inquiry. In Germany, Maercker
and Schneidewind; in France, Muntz and Girard; and in England,
Voelcker, Wood, Russell and others, have investigated these losses,
coming to very similar conclusions concerning them. Perhaps the
most complete set of experiments is one conducted at the Woburn
experimental station and extending over three years (1899-1901).
The dung was cake-fed manure made in feeding-boxes from which
no drainage issued, and, after removal, it was kept in a heap,
covered with earth. Hence it was made under as good conditions
as possible; but, even then, the losses&mdash;after deduction for live-weight
increase of the animals&mdash;were found to be 15% of the total
nitrogen of the food, during the making, and 34% (or a further 19%)
during storing and by the time the manure came to be put on the
land. Accordingly, under ordinary farm conditions it is quite
clear that only about 50% of the nitrogen of the food given is recovered
in the dung that goes on the land. This is the figure which
Lawes and Gilbert suggested in the practical application of their
Tables of Compensation for Unexhausted Manure Value.</p>

<p>During the fermentation of dung a large proportion of the non-nitrogenous
organic matters disappear in the forms of carbonic
acid and water, while another portion is converted into humic
acids which fix the ammonia gradually produced from the nitrogenous
constituents of the solid and liquid excreta. The mineral
matters remain behind entirely in the rotten dung, if care be taken
to prevent loss by drainage. For proper decomposition, both air
and moisture are requisite, while extreme dryness or too much
water will arrest the due fermentation of the mass.</p>

<p>Well-fermented dung is more concentrated and consequently
more efficacious than fresh farm-yard manure. Neither fresh nor
rotten dung contains any appreciable quantity of volatile ammonia,
and there is no advantage from applying gypsum, dilute acid,
superphosphate, kainit, or other substances recommended as fixers
of ammonia. If dung is carted into the field and spread out at
once in thin layers it will suffer comparatively little loss. But if
dung be kept for a length of time in shallow heaps, or in open
straw-yards and exposed to rain, it loses by drainage a considerable
proportion of its most valuable soluble fertilizing constituents.
Experiments with farm-yard manure kept in an open yard showed
that, after twelve months&rsquo; exposure to the weather, nearly all the
soluble nitrogen and 78.2% of the soluble mineral matters were
lost by drainage (A. Voelcker). To prevent this loss, farm-yard
manure, as had been pointed out, should, whenever possible, be
carted into the field, spread out at once, and ploughed in at the
convenience of the farmer. It is, however, not always practicable
to apply farm-yard manure just at the time it is made, and, as the
manure heap cannot be altogether dispensed with, it is necessary
to see how the manure may best be kept. The best dung is that
made in regular pits or feeding-boxes. In them the urine is
thoroughly absorbed, and, the manure being more compact through
the constant treading, air enters less freely and the decomposition
goes on less rapidly, the volatile matters, in consequence, not being
so readily lost. External agents, such as rain, wind, sun, &amp;c., do
not affect the manure as they would in the case of open yards.
Next best to box-fed manure is that made in covered yards, then
that in sheds, and lastly that in open yards. When removed from
the box or yard, the manure should be put in a heap upon a floor
of clay or well-beaten-down earth, and then be covered with earth.
When kept in an open yard, care should be taken not to let spoutings
of buildings lead on to it, and if there be a liquid-manure tank,
this might be pumped out over the manure again when the latter
is too dry.</p>

<p>The advantages of farm-yard manure consist, not only in its
supplying all the constituents of plant food, but also in the improved
physical condition of the soil which results from its application,
inasmuch as the land is thereby kept porous, and air is allowed
free access. While, however, farm-yard manure has these advantages,
experience has shown that artificial manures, properly
selected so as to meet the requirements of the crops intended to be
grown on the particular land, may be employed to greater advantage.
In farm-yard manure about two-thirds of the weight is water
and one-third dry matter; a large bulk thus contains only a small
proportion of fertilizing substances, and expense is incurred for
carriage of much useless matter when dung has to be carted to
distant fields. When a plentiful supply of good farm-yard manure
can be produced on the farm or bought at a moderate price in the
immediate neighbourhood, it is economy to use it either alone or
in conjunction with artificial manures; but when food is dear and
fattening does not pay, or farm-yard manure is expensive to buy,
it will be found more economical to use artificial manures. This
has obtained confirmation from the experience of Mr Prout, at
Sawbridgeworth, Herts, where since 1866, successive crops of corn
have been grown, and entirely with the use of artificial manures.</p>

<p>The real difficulty with farm-yard manure is to get enough of it,
and, if it were available in sufficiency, it would be safe to say that
farmers generally would not require to go farther in regard to the
manuring of any of the crops of the farm. Moreover, experiments
at Rothamsted and Woburn have shown of how &ldquo;lasting&rdquo; a character
farm-yard manure is, its influence having told for some 15
to 20 years after its application had ceased.</p>

<p>Light land is benefited by farm-yard manure through its supplying
to the soil organic matter, and imparting to it &ldquo;substance&rdquo; whereby
it becomes more consolidated and is better able to retain the manurial
ingredients given to it. By improving the soil&rsquo;s moisture-holding
capacity, moreover, &ldquo;burning&rdquo; of the land is prevented.</p>

<p>With heavy clay soils the advantages are that these are kept
more open in texture, drainage is improved, and the soil rendered
easier of working. On light land, well-rotted manure is best to
apply; and in spring, whereas on heavy land freshly-made, &ldquo;long,&rdquo;
manure is best, and should be put on in autumn or winter.</p>

<p>Farm-yard manure, where the supply is limited, is mostly saved
for the root-crop, which, however, generally needs a little superphosphate
to start it, as farm-yard manure is not sufficiently rich
in this constituent. It serves a great purpose in retaining the
needed moisture in the soil for the root crop.</p>

<p>For potato-growing, for vegetables, and in market-gardening,
farm-yard manure is almost indispensable. On grass-land and on
clover-ley it is also very useful, and in the neighbourhood of large
towns is employed greatly for the production of hay.</p>

<p>For corn crops also, and especially for wheat on heavy land,
farm-yard manure is much used, and, in a dry season in particular,
shows excellent results, though experiments at Rothamsted and
Woburn have shown that, on heavy and light land alike, heavier
crops of wheat and barley can be produced in average seasons by
artificial manures.</p>

<p><i>Seaweed.</i>&mdash;Along the sea-coast seaweed is collected, put in heaps
and allowed to rot, being subsequently used on the land, just as
farm-yard manure is. According to the nature of the weed and its
water-contents, it may have from .3 to 1% of nitrogen, or more,
with potash in some quantity.</p>

<p><i>Green-manuring.</i>&mdash;Though properly belonging to cultivation
rather than to manuring, and acting chiefly as a means of improving
the condition of the soil, the practice of green-manuring carries
with it manurial benefits also, in that it supplies humus and nitrogen
to the soil, and provides a substitute for farm-yard manure. The
ploughing-in of a leguminous green-crop which has collected nitrogen
from the atmosphere should result in a greater accumulation of
nitrogen for a succeeding corn-crop, and thus supply the cheapest
form of manuring. Green-manuring is most beneficial on light
land, poor in vegetable matter.</p>

<p><i>Manure Cakes, Malt Dust, Spent Hops, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;Many waste materials
of this kind are used because of their supplying, in the form of
nitrogenous organic matter, nitrogen for crop uses. The nitrogen
in these is of somewhat slow-acting, but lasting, nature. In addition
to nitrogen, some of these materials, <i>e.g.</i> rape cake, cotton cake
and castor cake, contain appreciable amounts of phosphoric acid
and potash. Rape cake, or &ldquo;land cake,&rdquo; as it is called in Norfolk,
is used considerably for wheat. It is also believed to be a preventive
of wireworm, and so is often employed for potatoes and
root-crops. Rape-seed from which the oil has been extracted by
chemical means, and which is called &ldquo;rape refuse,&rdquo; is made use of
in hop-gardens as a slowly acting supplier of nitrogen. It will
contain 4 to 5% of nitrogen with 3 to 4% of phosphates. Damaged
cotton and other feeding-cakes, no longer fit for feeding, are ground
into meal and put on the land. Castor cake is directly imported
for manurial purposes, and will have up to 5% of nitrogen with
4 to 5% of phosphates. Spent hops, malt dust and other waste
materials are similarly used. The principal use of these materials
is on light land, and to give bulk to the soil while supplying nitrogen
in suitable form.</p>

<p><i>Wool-dust, Shoddy, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;The clippings from wool, the refuse from
cloth factories, silk, fur and hair waste, carpet clippings and similar
waste materials are comprised in this category. They are valuable
purely for their nitrogen, and should be purchased according to
their nitrogen-contents. They are favourite materials with hop-growers
and fruit-farmers, whose experience leads them to prefer
a manure which supplies its nitrogen in organic form, and which
acts continuously, if not too readily. It is the custom in hop-lands
to manure the soil annually with large quantities of these waste
materials till it has much fertility stored up in it for succeeding
crops. According to its nature, wool-dust or shoddy may contain
anything from 3% of nitrogen up to 14%.</p>

<p>Leather is another waste material of the same class, but the
process of tanning it has undergone makes its nitrogen but very
slowly available and it is avoided, in consequence, as a manure.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page616" id="page616"></a>616</span>
There have been several processes started with the object of rendering
leather more useful as a manure.</p>

<p><i>Hoofs and Horns.</i>&mdash;The clippings and shavings from horn factories
are largely used by some hop-growers, and, though very slow in
their action, they will contain 14 to 15% of nitrogen. They are
sometimes very finely ground and sold as &ldquo;keronikon,&rdquo; chiefly
for use in compound artificial manures.</p>

<p><i>Dried Blood</i> is another purely nitrogenous material, which however
seldom finds its way to the farmer, being used up eagerly
by the artificial manure maker. It will contain from 12 to 14%
of nitrogen. It is obtained by simply evaporating down the blood
obtained from slaughter-houses. It is the most rapidly acting
of the organic nitrogenous materials enumerated, and, when obtainable,
is a favourite manure with fruit-growers, being also used for
root and vegetable growing.</p>

<p><i>Soot</i> is an article of very variable nature. It owes its manurial
value mainly to the ammonia salts it contains, and a good sample
will have about 4% of ammonia. It is frequently adulterated,
being mixed with ashes, earth, &amp;c. Flue sweepings of factory
chimneys are sometimes sold as soot, but possess little value. Besides
the ammonia that soot contains, there would undoubtedly
seem to be a value attaching to the carbonaceous matter. Soot is
a favourite top-dressing for wheat on heavy land, and is efficacious
in keeping off slugs, &amp;c. Speaking generally, the lighter a sample
of soot is the more likely is it to be genuine.</p>

<p><i>Sewage Manure.</i>&mdash;Where methods of dealing with the solid
matters of sewage are in operation, it frequently happens that
these matters are dried, generally with the aid of lime, and sold
locally. Occasionally they are prepared with the addition of other
fertilizing materials and made up as special manures. It may be
taken for granted that sewage refuse by itself is not worth transporting
to any distance. When made up with lime, the &ldquo;sludge,&rdquo; as
it is generally termed, is often useful because of the lime it contains.
But, on the whole, the value of such preparations has been greatly
exaggerated. Where land is in need of organic matter, or where
it is desirable to consolidate light land by the addition of material
of this class, sludge may, however, have decided value on mechanical
and physical grounds, but such land requires to be near at hand.</p>

<p class="pt1 center"><i>b. Imported or Manufactured Nitrogenous Manures.</i></p>

<p>These are nitrate of soda; sulphate of ammonia; calcium cyanamide;
calcium nitrate.</p>

<p><i>Nitrate of Soda.</i>&mdash;This is the best known and most generally used
of purely nitrogenous manures. It comes from the rainless districts
of Chile and Peru, from which it was first shipped about the year
1830. By 1899 the export had reached to 1,344,550 tons. It is
uncertain what its origin is, but it is generally believed to be the
deposit from an ancient sea which was raised by volcanic eruption
and its waters evaporated. Another theory puts it as the deposit
from the saline residues of fresh-water streams. The crude deposit
is termed <i>caliche</i>, and from this (which contains common salt and
sulphates of soda, potash and lime) the nitrate is crystallized out
and obtained as a salt containing 95 to 96% pure nitrate of
soda. It is sold on a basis of 95% pure, and is but little subject to
adulteration.</p>

<p>As a quickly acting nitrogenous manure nitrate of soda has no
equal, and it is in great demand as a top-dressing for corn crops, also
for roots. On grass-land, if used alone, it tends to produce grass
but to exterminate leguminous herbage. Its tendency with corn
crops is to produce, if used in quantity, inferiority of quality in grain.
It can be employed in conjunction with superphosphate and other
artificial manures, though it should not be mixed with them long
before the mixture is to be put on. It is a very soluble salt, and the
nitrogen being in the form of nitrates, it can be readily taken up
by plants. On the other hand, it is readily removed from the soil
by drainage, and its effects last only for a single season. Owing to
its solubility, it requires to be used in much larger amount than the
crop actually will take up. On a heavy soil it has a bad influence
if used repeatedly and in quantity, causing the land to &ldquo;run,&rdquo; and
making the tilth bad. Though, doubtless, exhaustive to the soil,
when used alone, there is no evidence yet of nitrate of soda causing
land to &ldquo;run out,&rdquo; as has been shown to be the case with sulphate
of ammonia. One cwt. to the acre is a common dressing for corn
crops, but for mangels it has been used to advantage up to 4 cwt.
per acre. As a top-dressing for corn crops it differs little in its crop-results
from its rival sulphate of ammonia, but in a dry season it
answers better, owing to its more ready solubility and quicker action,
whereas in a wet season sulphate of ammonia does better.</p>

<p><i>Sulphate of Ammonia.</i>&mdash;This is the great competitor with nitrate
of soda, and, like the latter, is useful purely as a nitrogenous manure.
It is obtained in the manufacture of gas and as a by-product in the
distillation of shale, &amp;c., as also from coke ovens. By adding
sulphuric acid to the ammoniacal liquor distilled over from the coal,
&amp;c., the salt is crystallized out. It is seldom adulterated, and, as
sold in commerce, generally contains 24 to 25% of ammonia. It is
not quite so readily soluble as nitrate of soda; it does not act quite
so quickly on crops, but is less easily removed from the soil by
drainage, leaving also a slight amount of residue for a second crop.
It is nearly as efficacious as a top-dressing for corn crops as is nitrate
of soda, and for some crops, <i>e.g.</i> potatoes, it is considered superior.
It may also be used like nitrate of soda for root crops. On grass-land
its effect in increasing gramineous but reducing leguminous herbage
is similar to that of nitrate of soda, but with corn crops it has not
the same deteriorating influence on the quality of grain. It can be
mixed quite well with superphosphate and other artificial manures,
and is therefore a common form in which nitrogen is supplied in
compound manures. It does not produce the bad effect on the tilth
of certain soils that nitrate of soda does, but it is open to the objection
that, if used continually on soil poor in lime, it will gradually
exhaust the soil and leave it in an acid condition, so that the soil is
unable to bear crops again until fertility is restored by the addition
of lime. A usual dressing of sulphate of ammonia is 1 cwt. per acre.</p>

<p><i>Calcium Cyanamide.</i>&mdash;This is a new product which represents
the earliest result of the utilization, in a commercial form, of atmospheric
nitrogen as a manurial substance. It is obtained by passing
nitrogen gas over the heated calcium carbide obtained in the electric
furnace, the nitrogen then uniting with the carbide to form calcium
cyanamide. The product contains from 19 to 20% of nitrogen,
and, though still under trial as a nitrogenous manure, it bids fair
to form a valuable source of supply, especially should the natural
deposits of nitrate of soda become exhausted. The cost of production
limits its manufacture to places where electrical power can be
cheaply generated. In its action it would seem to resemble most
closely sulphate of ammonia.</p>

<p><i>Calcium Nitrate.</i>&mdash;This is another product of the utilization of
atmospheric nitrogen as a manurial agent. Nitrogen and oxygen
are made to combine within the electric arc and the nitric acid produced
is then combined with lime, forming nitrate of lime. Nitrate
of lime contains, as put on the market, about 13% of nitrogen. In
its action it should be very similar to nitrate of soda, with, possibly,
some added benefit to certain soils by reason of the lime it contains.
Like cyanamide, it is still in the experimental stage as regards its
agricultural use, and can only be produced where electric power is
cheaply obtainable.</p>

<p>Neither material is altogether free from objection, the cyanamide
heating when mixed with other manures and even with soil, and
being liable to give off acetylene gas owing to the presence of calcium
carbide, whereas the calcium nitrate is a salt which on exposure to a
moist atmosphere readily deliquesces.</p>
</div>

<p class="pt1 center">II.&mdash;<span class="sc">Phosphatic Manures</span></p>

<p>Under the heading of manures that are used purely for their
phosphatic benefit to the soil are superphosphate and basic slag.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Superphosphate.</i>&mdash;This is the typical phosphatic manure, and is
the base of the numerous artificial manures used on the farm.
Superphosphate is made by dissolving raw phosphatic minerals in
sulphuric acid (oil of vitriol), the tribasic phosphate of lime which
these contain being converted into the so-called &ldquo;soluble phosphate,&rdquo;
sulphate of lime being formed at the same time. The first impetus
to the manufacture of superphosphate was given by Liebig, when
he suggested, in 1840, the treatment of bones with oil of vitriol
in order to make them act more quickly in the soil. Lawes
subsequently, in 1843, applied this to mineral phosphates, using
phosphorite, first of all, and the great manufacture of mineral
superphosphate then began. Coprolites, as found in Cambridgeshire,
Suffolk, Bedfordshire and elsewhere were the raw materials at first
employed in the United Kingdom. But gradually the demand
for the new manure became so great that distant parts of the world
were searched to bring in the raw material for conversion into
superphosphate. Many new sources of supply have been worked,
and many worked out or abandoned in favour of better and richer
phosphates. Among these were the crystalline apatites of Canada
and Norway, French, Spanish and German (Lahn) phosphates, and,
at a later period, Carolina (land and river), Florida, Tennessee,
Somme, Belgian, Algerian and Tunisian phosphates. In addition
to these came other materials which, in their origin, were really of
the nature of guano, being bird deposits the ammoniacal matters of
which were gradually washed out. The mineral matters remained
and altered the composition of the original rock on which the guano
was deposited, thus forming rich deposits of phosphate of lime.
Such were the phosphates obtained from many of the islands of the
West Indies and South Pacific, and known under such various names
as Sombrero, Curaçao, Aruba, Maiden Island, Megillones, Baker
Island, Fanning Islands, Lacepedes Islands, &amp;c. guanos. Few of
these are now worked, but their place has been largely taken by the
rich deposits of Ocean Island and Christmas Island, which are of
similar origin. The principal supplies of phosphatic minerals at
the present time come from Florida, Algeria, Tunis, Ocean Island
and Christmas Island. Other phosphates imported are Redonda
and Alta Vela phosphates, but these consist mainly of phosphate
of alumina, and are not used for superphosphate manufacture but
for phosphorus production.</p>

<p>Coprolites, as formerly used, contained from 50 to 60% of phosphate
of lime, but they are not worked now, the richer sources, which
are also better adapted for superphosphate manufacture, having
taken their place. The amount of oxide of iron and alumina in raw
phosphates is of great importance, as phosphates containing these
bodies are liable to cause superphosphate to &ldquo;go back&rdquo; or form
what is called &ldquo;reverted&rdquo; phosphate, the percentage of &ldquo;soluble
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page617" id="page617"></a>617</span>
phosphate&rdquo; being reduced thereby. For this reason many of the
older supplies have been replaced by newer and better ones. Florida
rock phosphate of high grade contains 75 to 78% of phosphate of
lime, and Florida land pebble phosphate about 70%. Algerian
and Tunisian phosphates have from 55 to 65% of phosphate of lime,
and are very free from iron and alumina, this fitting them especially
for superphosphate making. Tennessee phosphate has about 70%
of phosphate, Somme and Belgian phosphates 40 to 50%, while
Ocean Island and Christmas Island phosphates are of very high
grade and yield over 80 and up to 86% of phosphate of lime. Superphosphate
is made by finely grinding the raw phosphate and mixing
it with oil of vitriol (chamber acid); what actual product is formed
is a matter of some uncertainty, but it is a phosphate soluble in water,
and believed to be mono-calcic phosphate. This is the true &ldquo;soluble
phosphate,&rdquo; but in commercial transactions it is universal to express
the amount in terms of the original tribasic phosphate which has
been rendered soluble. Ordinary grades of mineral superphosphate
give from 25 to 27% of soluble phosphate and higher grades 30 to
35%. On reaching the soil, the soluble phosphate becomes precipitated
by the calcium and iron compounds in the soil. But it is
precipitated in a very fine form of division, in which it is readily
attacked by the plant roots. Superphosphate is used practically
for all crops, including cereals, clover and other leguminous crops.
Its use tends to early maturity in a crop. Its value for giving a start
to root crops is particularly recognized, and root crops generally
are dependent on it, as they have little power of utilizing the phosphoric
acid in the soil itself. On land poor in lime superphosphate
must be used with caution owing to its acid nature, and in such cases
an undissolved phosphate is preferable. The quantity in which it
is applied ranges from 2 and 3 cwt. per acre to 5 cwt. It suffers but
little loss through drainage, and will exercise an influence on crops
beyond the year of application.</p>

<p><i>Basic Slag.</i>&mdash;This other principal phosphatic manure is of more
recent origin, and is an undissolved phosphate. It is the waste
product of steel-making where the Thomas-Gilchrist or &ldquo;basic&rdquo;
process of manufacture has been employed. This process is used
with ores containing much phosphorus, the removal of which is
necessary in steel-manufacture. The &ldquo;converters&rdquo; which hold
the molten iron are lined with lime and magnesia, and the impurities
of the iron form a &ldquo;slag&rdquo; with these materials. For a long time
the slag was regarded as a waste product, but ultimately it was
found that, by grinding it very finely, it had distinct agricultural
value, and now its use is universal. Basic slag is of various grades,
containing 12 to 20% of phosphoric acid, which is believed
to exist in the form of a tetracalcic phosphate. This phosphate is
found to be readily attacked by a weak solution of citric acid, and this
probably accounts for the comparative ease with which plants can
utilize the phosphate. With it is also a good deal of lime, and the
presence of this undoubtedly, in many cases, accounts partly for the
benefits that follow the use of basic slag. It should be very finely
ground; a common standard is that 80 to 90% should pass through
a sieve having 10,000 meshes to the square inch.</p>

<p>The principal use of basic slag is on grass-land, especially where
the soil is heavy or clayey. Its effect on such land in causing white
clover to appear is in many cases most remarkable, and without
doubt, much poor, cold grass-land has been immensely benefited by
its use. It is also employed for root crops; but its effect on these,
as on cereals, is not so marked as on grass-land. On light land its
benefit is not nearly so great or universal as on heavier land.</p>
</div>

<p class="pt1 center">III.&mdash;<span class="sc">Manures containing Nitrogen and Phosphates</span></p>

<p>These may be classified as follows: (<i>a</i>) Natural manures&mdash;bones,
fish and meat guanos, Peruvian guano, bats&rsquo; guano;
(<i>b</i>) Manufactured manures&mdash;dissolved bones, compound
manures.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p class="pt1 center"><i>a. Natural Manures</i></p>

<p><i>Bones.</i>.&mdash;The value and use of these in agriculture has long been
known, as also the comparative slowness of their action, which latter
induced Liebig to suggest their treatment with sulphuric acid.
Natural bones will contain from 45 to 50% of phosphate of lime with
4 to 4½% of nitrogen. It is usual to boil bones lightly after collection,
in order to remove the adhering particles of flesh and the fat. If
steamed under pressure the nitrogenous matter is to a great extent
extracted, yielding glue, size, gelatine, &amp;c., and the bones&mdash;known
then in agriculture as &ldquo;steamed bones&rdquo;&mdash;will contain from 55 to
60% of phosphate of lime with 1 to 1½% of nitrogen. Bones are also
imported from India, and these are of a very hard and dry nature.
Bones are principally used for root crops, and to some extent on grass-land.
The more finely they are ground the quicker is their action,
but they are a slow-acting manure, which remains some years in the
land. Mixed with superphosphate, bone meal forms an excellent
manure for roots, and obviates the difficulty of using superphosphate
on land poor in lime. Steamed bones, sometimes ground into
flour, are much used in dairy pastures.</p>

<p><i>Fish and Meat Guanos.</i>&mdash;The term &ldquo;guano,&rdquo; though generally
applied to these manures, is wrongly so used, for they are in no sense
guano (meaning thereby the droppings of sea birds). They are really
fish or meat refuse, being generally the dried fish-offal or the residue
from meat-extract manufacture. They vary much in composition,
according to their origin, some being highly nitrogenous (11 to 12%
nitrogen) and comparatively low in phosphate of lime, and others
being more highly phosphatic (30 to 40% phosphate of lime) with
lower nitrogen. These materials are to some extent used for root
and vegetable crops, and chiefly for hop-growing, but they go largely
also to the artificial manure maker.</p>

<p><i>Peruvian Guano.</i>&mdash;This material, though once a name to conjure
with, has now not much more than an academic interest, owing to
the rapid exhaustion of the supplies. It is true guano, <i>i.e.</i> the deposit
of sea birds, and was originally found on islands off the coast of Peru.
Peruvian guano was first discovered in 1804 by A. von Humboldt,
and the wonderful results attending its use gave an enormous impulse
to its exportation. The Chincha Islands yielded the finest qualities
of guano, this giving up to 14 and 15% of nitrogen. Gradually the
Chincha Islands deposits became worked out, and other sources,
such as the Pabellon de Pica, Lobos, Guanape and Huanillos deposits
were worked in turn. In many instances the guano had suffered
from washing by rain or by decomposition, or in other cases the
bare rock was reached and the shipments contained some considerable
quantity of this rocky matter, so that the highly nitrogenous
guanos were no longer forthcoming and deposits more phosphatic
in character took their place. Gradually the shipments fell off, and
with them the great reputation of the guano as a manure. On some
of the islands the birds, after having been driven off, have returned
and fresh deposits are being formed. On the west coast of Africa
also some new deposits have been found, and a certain amount of
guano comes from Ichaboe Island; but the trade will never be what
it once was. Occasional shipments come from the Ballista Islands,
giving from 10 to 11% of nitrogen with 11 to 12% of phosphoric
acid, and lower-grade guanos (7% of nitrogen and 16% of phosphoric
acid) are arriving from Guanape, while from Lobos de Tierra
comes a still lower grade.</p>

<p>The particular feature that marked guano was that it contained
both its nitrogenous and phosphatic ingredients in forms in which
they could be very readily assimilated by plants. Moreover, the
occurrence of the nitrogenous and phosphatic matters in different
forms of combination gave to them a special value, and one that
could not be exactly imitated in artificial manures. The nitrogenous
matters, <i>e.g.</i>, exist as urates, carbonates, oxalates and phosphates
of ammonia, and a particular nitrogenous body termed &ldquo;guanine&rdquo;
is also found. Guano contains much alkaline salts, and is, from its
containing alike phosphates, nitrogen and potash in suitable forms
and quantity, an exceedingly well balanced manure. In agriculture
it is used for corn crops, and also for root crops, potatoes and hops.
It is esteemed for barley, as tending to produce good quality. For
vegetable and market-garden crops that require forcing guano is also
still in demand. The more phosphatic kinds are sometimes treated
with sulphuric acid, and constitute &ldquo;Dissolved Peruvian Guano.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Bats&rsquo; Guano.</i>&mdash;In caves in New Zealand, parts of America, South
Africa and elsewhere, are found deposits formed by bats, and these
are used to some extent as a manure, though they have no great
commercial value.</p>

<p class="pt1 center"><i>b. Manufactured Manures</i></p>

<p><i>Dissolved Bones.</i>&mdash;These are bones treated with oil of vitriol, as
in superphosphate manufacture. By this treatment bones become
much more readily available, and are used to a considerable extent,
more especially for root crops. Their composition varies with the
method of manufacture and the extent to which they are dissolved.
Speaking generally, they will have from 11 to 19% of soluble phosphate,
with 20 to 24% of insoluble phosphates, and if pure should
contain 3% of nitrogen. When mixed with superphosphate in varying
amount, or if made with steamed and not raw bone, they are
generally known under the indefinite name of &ldquo;bone manure.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Compound Manures.</i>&mdash;To this class belong the manures of every
description which it is the aim of the artificial manure manufacturer
to compound for particular purposes or to suit particular soils or
crops. The base of all these is, as a rule, mineral superphosphate
or else dissolved bones, or the two together, and with these are mixed
numerous different manurial substances calculated to supply definite
amounts of nitrogen, potash, &amp;c. Such manures, the trade in which
is a very large one, are variously known as &ldquo;corn manure,&rdquo; &ldquo;turnip
manure,&rdquo; &ldquo;grass manure&rdquo; and the like, and much care is bestowed
on their compounding and on their preparation in good condition to
allow of their ready distribution over the land.</p>
</div>

<p class="pt1 center">IV.&mdash;<span class="sc">Potash Manures</span></p>

<p>These, with few exceptions, are natural products from the
potash mines of Stassfurt (Prussia). Until the discovery of these
deposits, in 1861, the use of potash as a fertilizing constituent
was very limited, being confined practically to the employment
of wood ashes. At the present time a small quantity of potash
salts&mdash;principally carbonate of potash&mdash;is obtained from sugar
refinery and other manufacturing processes, but the great bulk
of the potash supply comes from the German mines. In these
the different natural salts occur in different layers and in
conjunction with layers of rock-salt, carbonate of lime and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page618" id="page618"></a>618</span>
other minerals, from which they have to be separated out and
undergo subsequently a partial purification by re-crystallization.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The principal potash salts used in agriculture are&mdash;(1) sulphate of
potash, which is about 90% pure; (2) kainit, an impure form of
sulphate of potash, and containing much common salt and magnesia
salts, and giving about 12% of potash (K<span class="su">2</span>O); (3) muriate of potash,
which is used to a great extent in agriculture, and contains 75 to
90% of muriate of potash; and (4) potash manure salts, a mixture
of different salts and containing from 20 to 30% of potash.</p>

<p>Potash is much esteemed in agriculture, more especially on light
land (which is frequently deficient in it) and on peaty soils, and for
use with root crops and potatoes in particular. For fruit and vegetable
growing and for flowers potash manures are in constant request.
Clay land, as a rule, is not benefited by their use, these <span class="correction" title="amended from oils">soils</span> containing
generally an abundance of potash. Along with basic slag, potash
salts have been frequently used for grass on light land with advantage.</p>
</div>

<p class="pt1 center">V.&mdash;<span class="sc">Miscellaneous Manures</span></p>

<p>There are, in addition to the foregoing, certain materials which
in a limited sense only can be called &ldquo;manures,&rdquo; but the influences
of which are mostly seen in the mechanical and physical
improvements which they effect in soil. Such are salt, and also
lime in its different forms.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Salt.</i>&mdash;The action of salt in liberating potash from the soil has been
explained. As a manure it is sometimes used along with nitrate
of soda as a top-dressing for corn crops, in the belief that it stiffens
the straw. For root crops also, and mangels in particular, it is
employed; also for cabbage and other vegetables.</p>

<p><i>Lime.</i>&mdash;The use of this is almost solely to be considered as a soil
improvement, and not as that of a manure. Sulphate of lime
(gypsum) is, however, occasionally used as a dressing for clover, and
also for hops. The fact that superphosphate itself contains a considerable
amount of sulphate of lime renders the special application
of gypsum unnecessary, as a rule.</p>

<p>As compared with &ldquo;natural&rdquo; manures, like farm-yard manure,
artificial manures have the disadvantage that they, unlike it, do not
improve the physical condition of the soil. Artificial manures have,
however, the advantage over farm-yard manure that they can supply
in a small compass, and even if used in small quantity, the needed
nitrogen, phosphoric acid and potash, &amp;c., which crops require,
and which farm-yard manure has but in small proportion. They,
further, present the expensive fertilizing matters in a concentrated
form, and by their application save expense in labour.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MANUSCRIPT,<a name="ar174" id="ar174"></a></span> a term applied to any document written by
the human hand (Lat. <i>manû scriptum</i>) with the aid of pen, pencil
or other instrument which can be used with cursive facility, as
distinguished from an inscription engraved with chisel or graver,
worked laboriously. By usage the word has come to be employed
in a special sense to indicate a written work of the ancient world
or of the middle ages; collections of such &ldquo;ancient manuscripts&rdquo;
being highly prized and being stored for preservation in public
libraries. Down to the time of the invention of printing, and
until the printed book had driven it out of the field, the manuscript
was the vehicle for the conservation and dissemination of
literature, and discharged all the functions of the modern book.
In the present article a description is given of the development
of the ancient manuscript, particularly among the Greeks and
Romans, leading on to the medieval manuscripts of Europe,
and bringing down the history of the latter to the invention of
printing; the history of the printed volume is dealt with in the
article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Book</a></span> (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Materials.</i>&mdash;The handbooks on palaeography describe in full the
different materials which have been employed from remote time
to receive writing, and may be referred to for minuter details. To
dispose, in the first place, of the harder materials that have been put
under requisition, we find metals both referred to by writers and
actually represented by surviving examples. Thin leaves of gold
or silver were recommended for the inscription of charms in particular.
Leaden plates were in common use for incantations; the material
was cheap and was supposed to be durable. On such plates were
scratched the <i>dirae</i> or solemn devotions of obnoxious persons to the
infernal deities; many examples have survived. As an instance
of the use of soft substance afterwards hardened may be cited the
practice by the Babylonians and Assyrians of writing, or rather of
puncturing, their cuneiform characters on clay tablets while moist,
which were afterwards dried in the heat of the sun or baked in the
oven. Potsherds, or <i>ostraka</i>, were employed for all kinds of temporary
purposes. Thousands of them have been found in Egypt
inscribed with tax receipts and ephemeral drafts and memoranda,
children&rsquo;s dictation lessons, &amp;c. Analogous to the clay documents
of western Asia are the tablets coated with wax in vogue among the
Greeks and Romans, offering a surface not to be inscribed with the
pen but to be scratched with the sharp pointed <i>stilus</i>. These will
be described more fully below. With them we class the wooden
boards, generally whitened with a coating of paint or composition
and adapted for the pen, which were common in Egypt, and were
specially used for educational purposes. Such boards were also
employed for official notices in Athens in the 4th century <span class="scs">B.C.</span></p>

<p>Of the more pliant, and therefore generally more convenient,
substances there were many, such as animal skins and vegetable
growths. Practically we might confine our attention to three of
them: papyrus, parchment or vellum, and paper, the employment
of which, each in turn, as a writing material became almost universal.
But there are also others which must be mentioned.</p>

<p>In a primitive state of society leaves of plants and trees strong
enough for the purpose might be taken as a ready-made material
to receive writing. Palm leaves are used for this purpose to the
present day in parts of India; and the references in classical authors
to leaves as early writing material among the Greeks and Romans
cannot be dismissed as entirely fanciful.</p>

<p>The bark of trees, and particularly the inner bark of the lime-tree,
<span class="grk" title="philyra,">&#966;&#953;&#955;&#973;&#961;&#945;</span> <i>tilia</i>, was employed. The fact that the Latin word <i>liber</i>,
bark, eventually meant also a book, would be sufficient proof that
that material was once in common literary use, even if it were not
referred to by writers.</p>

<p>Linen, too, was a writing material among the early Romans, as it
was also among the Etruscans, and as it had been to some extent
among the Egyptians.</p>

<p>Skins of animals, tanned, have doubtless served as a writing
material from the very earliest period of the use of letters. The
Egyptians occasionally employed this material. Instances of the
use of leather in western Asia are recorded by ancient authors, and
from Herodotus we learn that the Ionian Greeks applied to the rolls of
the later-imported papyrus the title <span class="grk" title="diphtherai">&#948;&#953;&#966;&#952;&#941;&#961;&#945;&#953;</span>, skins, by which they
had designated their writing material of leather. The Jews, also,
to the present day hold to the ancient Eastern custom and inscribe
the law upon skin rolls.</p>

<p>But generally these materials were superseded in the old world
by the famous Egyptian writing material manufactured from the
papyrus plant, which gradually passed beyond the boundaries of its
native land and was imported at a remote period into other countries.
Into Greece and into Rome it was introduced at so early a time that
practically it was the vehicle for classical literature throughout its
course. A description of the manufacture and use of this material
will be found under <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Papyrus</a></span>. Here it need only be noted that
papyrus is associated in Greek and Roman literature with the roll
form of the ancient manuscript, as will be more fully explained below,
and that it was the supersession of this material by parchment or
vellum which led to the change of shape to the book form.</p>

<p>The introduction of the new material, parchment or vellum, was
not a revival of the use of animal skins as followed by the old world.
The skins were now not tanned into leather, but were prepared by
a new process to provide a material, thin, strong, flexible, and smooth
of surface on both faces. This improved process was the secret
of the success of the new material in ousting the time-honoured
papyrus from its high position. The common story, as told by
Pliny, that Eumenes II. of Pergamum (197-158 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), seeking to
extend the library of his capital, was opposed by the jealousy of the
Ptolemies, who forbade the export of papyrus, hoping thus to check
the growth of a rival library, and that he was thus compelled to have
recourse to skins as a writing material, at all events points to Pergamum
as the chief centre of trade in the material, <span class="grk" title="pergamênê,">&#960;&#949;&#961;&#947;&#945;&#956;&#951;&#957;&#942;</span>
<i>charta pergamena</i>. The old terms <span class="grk" title="diphtherai">&#948;&#953;&#966;&#952;&#941;&#961;&#945;&#953;</span>, <i>membranae</i>, applied
originally to the older leather, were transferred to the newly improved
substance. In describing MSS. written on, this material,
by common consent the term parchment has in modern times given
place to that of vellum, properly applicable only to calfskin, but
now generally used in reference to a medieval skin-book of any kind.
Parchment is a title now usually reserved for the hard sheepskin
or other skin material on which law deeds are engrossed. (See
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Parchment</a></span>.)</p>

<p>Vellum had a long career as a writing material for the literature
of the early centuries of our era and of the middle ages. But in its
turn it eventually gave place to paper (<i>q.v.</i>). As early as the 13th
century paper, an Asiatic invention, was making its way into Europe
and was adopted in the Eastern Empire as a material for Greek
literature side by side with vellum. It soon afterwards began to
appear in the countries of southern Europe. In the course of the
14th century the use of it became fairly established, and in the middle
of the century a number of paper manuscripts were produced along
with those on vellum, particularly in Italy. Finally, in the 15th
century paper became the common material for the manuscript
book. The new paper, however, made no further change in the
form of the manuscript. It possessed exactly the same qualities,
as a writing material, as vellum: it could be inscribed on both sides;
it could be made up into quires and bound in the codex form; and
it had the further advantage of being easily manufactured in large
quantities, and therefore of being comparatively cheap.</p>

<p><i>The Forms of the Manuscript Book.</i>&mdash;In describing the development
of the manuscript book in the ancient world, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page619" id="page619"></a>619</span>
subsequently in the middle ages, we have to deal with it in two
forms. The common form of the book of the ancient world was
the <i>roll</i>, composed of one continuous sheet of material and
inscribed only on one side. This form had a long career. In
Egyptian literature it can be traced back for thousands of
years. In Greek literature it may he assumed to have been
in vogue from the earliest times; actual examples have survived
of the latter part of the 4th and beginning of the 3rd
centuries <span class="scs">B.C.</span> As to its early use in Latin literature we cannot
speak so definitely; but Rome followed the example of Greece
in letters, and therefore no doubt also in the material shape
of literary productions. Both in Greek and Latin literature
the roll lasted down to the early centuries of the Christian
era. It was superseded by the <i>codex</i>, the manuscript in book
form (in the modern sense of the word book), composed of
separate leaves stitched together into quires and made available
to receive writing on both sides of the material. This
form is still in vogue as the modern printed book, and probably
will never be superseded. But the codex in this developed
shape was only an evolution from the early waxen tablets of
the Greeks and Romans, two or more of which, hinged together,
formed the primitive codex which suggested the later form.
Therefore it will be necessary to include the description of the
tablets with that of the later codex.</p>

<p>The ordinary terms in use among the Greeks for a book (that
is, a roll) were <span class="grk" title="biblos">&#946;&#973;&#946;&#955;&#959;&#962;</span> (another form of <span class="grk" title="bublos">&#946;&#973;&#946;&#955;&#959;&#962;</span>, papyrus) and
its diminutive <span class="grk" title="biblion">&#946;&#953;&#946;&#955;&#943;&#959;&#957;</span>, which included the idea of a
written book. The corresponding Latin terms were
<span class="sidenote">The Roll.</span>
<i>liber</i> and <i>libellus</i>; <i>volumen</i> was a rolled-up roll. A roll of material
uninscribed was <span class="grk" title="chàrtês">&#967;&#940;&#961;&#964;&#951;&#962;</span>, <i>charta</i>, or <span class="grk" title="tomos">&#964;&#972;&#956;&#959;&#962;</span> (originally a <i>cutting</i> of
papyrus), applicable also to a roll containing a portion or
division of a large work which extended to more than one
roll. A work contained within the compass of a single roll was
a <span class="grk" title="monobiblos">&#956;&#959;&#957;&#972;&#946;&#953;&#946;&#955;&#959;&#962;</span>, or <span class="grk" title="monobiblon">&#956;&#959;&#957;&#972;&#946;&#953;&#946;&#955;&#959;&#957;</span>. The term <span class="grk" title="teuchos">&#964;&#949;&#8166;&#967;&#959;&#962;</span> seems also to
have meant a single roll, but it was also applied at a later time
to indicate a work contained in several rolls.</p>

<p>In writing the text of a work, the scribe might choose to make
use of separate sheets of papyrus, <span class="grk" title="kollêmata">&#954;&#959;&#955;&#955;&#942;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945;</span>, <i>schedae</i>, and
then join them to one another consecutively so as to make up the
roll; or he might purchase from the stationers a <i>scapus</i>, or ready-made
roll of twenty sheets at most; and if this length were not
sufficient, he might add other sheets or <i>scapi</i>, and thus make a
roll of indefinite length. But proverbially a great book was a
great evil, and, considering the inconvenience of unrolling a
long roll, not only for perusal, but, still more so, for occasional
reference, the practice of subdividing lengthy works into divisions
of convenient size, adapted to the capacity of moderate-sized
rolls, must have come into vogue at a very early period.</p>

<p>It was the practice to write on one side only of the papyrus;
to write on both front and back of a roll would obviously be a
clumsy and irritating method. Works intended for the market
were never <i>opisthograph</i>. Of course the blank backs of written
rolls which had become obsolete might be turned to account for
personal or temporary purposes, as we learn not only from references
in classical authors but also from actual examples. The
most interesting extant case of an opisthograph papyrus is the
copy of Aristotle&rsquo;s <i>Constitution of Athens</i> in the British Museum,
which is written on the back of a farmer&rsquo;s accounts, of the end
of the 1st century&mdash;but only for private use. It being the rule,
then, to confine the writing to one side of the material, that is,
to the inner surface of the made-up roll, that surface was more
carefully prepared and smoothed than the other; and, further,
the joints of the several sheets were so well made that they offered
no obstacle to the action of the pen. Still further, care was taken
that this, the <i>recto</i> surface of the material, should be that in
which the shreds of papyrus of which it was composed lay
horizontally, so that the pen might move freely along the fibres;
the shreds of the <i>verso</i> side, on the other hand, being in vertical
position. This point is of some importance, as, in cases where
two different handwritings are found on the two sides of a
papyrus, it may be usually assumed that the one on the <i>recto</i>
surface is the earlier.</p>

<p>The text was written in columns, <span class="grk" title="selides">&#963;&#949;&#955;&#943;&#948;&#949;&#962;</span>, <i>paginae</i>, the width
of which seems not to have been prescribed, but which for
calligraphic effect were by preference made narrow, sufficient
margins being left at head and foot. The average width of the
columns in the best extant papyri ranges from two to three-and-a-half
inches. The written lines were parallel with the length
of the roll, so that the columns stood, so to say, with the height
of the rolled-up roll, and were disclosed consecutively as the roll
was unwound. Ruling with lead to guide the writing is mentioned
by writers, but it does not appear that the practice was generally
followed. The number of lines in the several columns of extant
papyri is not constant, nor is the marginal boundary of the
beginnings of the lines, for the accuracy of which a ruled vertical
line would have proved useful, ordinarily kept even. No doubt
in practice the horizontal fibres of the material were found to
afford a sufficient guide for the lines of writing.</p>

<p>If the title of the work was to be given, the scribe appears to
have written it ordinarily at the end of the text. But something
more was needed. To be obliged to unroll a text to the end, in
order to ascertain the name of the author, would be the height
of inconvenience. Its title was therefore sometimes written at
the head of the text. It appears also that at an early period it
was inscribed on the outside of the roll, so as to be visible as the
roll lay in a chest or on the shelf. But a more general practice
was to attach to the top edge of the roll a label or ticket, <span class="grk" title="sillubos">&#963;&#943;&#955;&#955;&#965;&#946;&#959;&#962;</span>,
or <span class="grk" title="sittubos">&#963;&#943;&#964;&#964;&#965;&#946;&#959;&#962;</span>, <i>titulus</i>, <i>index</i>, which hung down if the roll lay on
the shelf, or was conveniently read if the roll stood along with
others in the ordinary cylindrical roll-box, <span class="grk" title="kistê">&#954;&#943;&#963;&#964;&#951;</span>, <span class="grk" title="kibotos">&#954;&#953;&#946;&#969;&#964;&#972;&#962;</span>,
<i>cista</i>, <i>capsa</i>. One such label made of papyrus has survived and
is in the British Museum.</p>

<p>The scribe would not commence his text at the very beginning,
nor would he carry it quite down to the end, of the roll. He
would leave blank a sufficient length of material at either extremity,
where the roll would naturally be most exposed to wear
and tear by handling in unrolling and re-rolling; and, further,
the extreme vertical edges might each be strengthened by the
addition of a strip of papyrus so as to form a double thickness of
material.</p>

<p>According to the particulars given by classical authors, the
roll would be finished off somewhat elaborately; but the details
described by them must be taken to apply to the more expensive
productions of the book trade, corresponding with the full-bound
volumes of our days. In practice, a large proportion of
working copies and ordinary editions must have been dealt with
more simply. Firstly, the roll should be rolled up round a
central stick, of wood or bone, called the <span class="grk" title="omphalos">&#972;&#956;&#966;&#945;&#955;&#972;&#962;</span>, <i>umbilicus</i>,
to which the last sheet of the papyrus may or may not have been
attached. But as a matter of fact no rolling-sticks have been
found in company with extant papyri, and it has therefore been
suggested that they were not attached to the material but were
rolled in loose, and were therefore liable to drop out. In some
instances, as in the rolls found at Herculaneum, a central core of
papyrus instead of a stick was thought sufficient. The edges,
<i>frontes</i>, of the roll, after it had been rolled up, were shorn and were
rubbed smooth with pumice, and they were sometimes coloured.
A valuable roll might be protected with a vellum wrapper,
<span class="grk" title="phainolês">&#966;&#945;&#953;&#957;&#972;&#955;&#951;&#962;</span>, <i>paenula</i>, stained with colour; and, further, it might
be secured with ornamental thongs. The central stick might
also be adorned with knobs or &ldquo;horns,&rdquo; plain or coloured. This
seems to be the natural explanation of the <span class="grk" title="kerata">&#954;&#941;&#961;&#945;&#964;&#945;</span>, or <i>cornua</i>,
mentioned by the ancient writers. Finally, the title-label
described above was attached to the completed roll, now ready
for the book-market.</p>

<p>In the perusal of a work the reader held the roll upright and
unrolled it gradually with the right hand; with the left hand
he rolled up in the reverse direction what he had read. Thus,
when he had finished, the roll had become reversed, the beginning
of the text being now in the centre of the roll and the end of it
being outside. The roll was &ldquo;explicitus ad umbilicum,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;ad sua cornua.&rdquo; It had therefore now to be unrolled afresh
and to be re-rolled into its normal shape&mdash;a troublesome process
which the lazy man shirked, and which the careful man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page620" id="page620"></a>620</span>
accomplished by making the revolutions with his two hands
while he held the revolving material steady under his chin.</p>

<p>Although the codex or manuscript in book-form began to
make its way in Greek and Roman literature as early as the 1st
century of our era, the roll maintained its position as the recognized
type of literary document down to the 3rd, and even into
the 4th, century, when it was altogether superseded. We shall
proceed to describe the codex after giving some account of the
waxen, or, to speak more correctly, the waxed, tablet, its precursor
in the book-form.</p>

<p>The ordinary waxen tablet in use among the Greeks and
Romans was a small oblong slab of wood, beech, fir, and especially
box, the surface of which on one or both sides, with
the exception of the surrounding margins which were
<span class="sidenote">The Waxen Tablet.</span>
left intact in order to form a frame, was sunk to a
slight depth and was therein coated with a thin layer of wax,
usually black. The tablet thus presented the appearance of a
child&rsquo;s school-slate of the present day. Such tablets were single,
double, triple, or of several pieces or leaves. In Greek they
were called <span class="grk" title="pinax">&#960;&#943;&#957;&#945;&#958;</span>, <span class="grk" title="pinakis">&#960;&#953;&#957;&#945;&#954;&#943;&#962;</span>, <span class="grk" title="déltos">&#948;&#941;&#955;&#964;&#959;&#962;</span>, <span class="grk" title="deltion">&#948;&#949;&#955;&#964;&#943;&#959;&#957;</span>.: in Latin <i>cera</i>,
<i>tabula</i>, <i>tabella</i>, &amp;c. Two or more put together and held together
by rings or thongs acting as hinges formed a <i>caudex</i> or <i>codex</i>,
literally a stock of wood, which a set of tablets might resemble,
and from which they might actually be made by cleaving the
wood. A codex of two leaves was called <span class="grk" title="dithuroi">&#948;&#943;&#952;&#965;&#961;&#959;&#953;</span>, <span class="grk" title="diptucha">&#948;&#943;&#960;&#964;&#965;&#967;&#945;</span>,
<i>diptycha</i>; of three, <span class="grk" title="triptucha">&#964;&#961;&#943;&#960;&#964;&#965;&#967;&#945;</span>, <i>triptycha</i>: and so on. The
triptych appears to have been most generally used. A general
term was also <i>libellus</i>.</p>

<p>Tablets served for the ordinary minor affairs of life: for memoranda,
literary and other notes and drafts, school exercises,
accounts, &amp;c. The writing incised with the stilus could be easily
obliterated by smoothing the wax, and the <i>tabula rasa</i> was thus
rendered available for a fresh inscription. But tablets were also
employed for official purposes, when documents had to be
protected from unauthorized scrutiny or from injury. Thus
they were the receptacles for wills, conveyances, and other legal
transactions; and in such cases they were closed against inspection
by being bound round with threads which were covered by
the witnesses&rsquo; seals.</p>

<p>Small tablets, <i>codicilli</i>, <i>pugillares</i>, often of more valuable
material, such as ivory, served for correspondence among other
purposes; very small specimens are mentioned as <i>vitelliani</i>, for
the exchange of love-letters.</p>

<p>A certain number of Greek waxen tablets have been recovered,
chiefly from Egypt, but none of them is very early. They are
generally of the 3rd century, and are mostly inscribed with
school exercises. The largest and most perfect extant codex is
one in the British Museum (Add. MS. 33,270), perhaps of the
3rd century, being made up of nine leaves, measuring nearly
9 by 7 in., and inscribed with documents in shorthand.</p>

<p>Of Latin tablets we are fortunate in having a fairly large
number of examples. Exclusive of a few isolated specimens,
they are the result of two important finds. Twenty-four tablets
containing the records of a burial club, <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 131-167, were recovered
between 1786 and 1855 from some ancient mining works
in Dacia. In 1875 as many as 127 tablets, containing deeds connected
with sales by auction and payment of taxes, <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 15-62,
were found in the ruins of Pompeii. These specimens have
afforded the means of ascertaining the mechanical arrangement
of waxen tablets when adopted for legal instruments among
the Romans. Most of them are triptychs, severally cloven from
single blocks of wood. Subject to some variations, the triptych
was usually arranged as follows. Of the six sides or pages of the
codex, pages 1 and 6 (the outside pages) were of plain wood; pages
2, 3, 5 were waxed; and page 4, which had a groove cut across the
middle was sometimes of plain wood, sometimes waxed. The
authentic deed was inscribed with the stilus on the waxed pages
2 and 3; and the first two leaves were then bound round with
three twisted threads which passed down the groove so as to
close the deed from inspection. On page 4 the witnesses&rsquo; names
were then inscribed (in ink if the page was plain; with the stilus
if waxed), and their seals were impressed in the groove, thus
securing the threads. In addition to the protection afforded to
the seals from casual injury by their position in the groove, the
third leaf acted as a cover to them. On page 5 an abstract or
duplicate of the deed, as required by law, was inscribed. The
arrangement of the Dacian tablets differed in this respect, that
page 4 was waxed, and that the duplicate copy was begun on
that page in the space on the left of the groove, that on the right
being reserved for the names of the witnesses. In the case
of one of the Pompeian tablets the threads and seals still remain.</p>

<p>The survival of the use of tablets to a late time should be noted.
St Augustine refers to his tablets, and St Hilary of Arles also
mentions their employment for the purpose of correspondence;
there is a record of a letter written <i>in tabellâ</i> as late as <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 1148.
They were very commonly used throughout the middle ages in
all the west of Europe. Specimens inscribed with money accounts
of the 13th and 14th centuries have survived in France, and
similar documents of the 14th and 15th centuries are to be found
in several of the municipal archives of Germany. Reference to
their use in England occurs in literature, and specimens of the
14th or 15th century are said to have been dug up in Ireland.
In Italy their employment is both recorded and proved by actual
examples of the 13th and 14th centuries. With the beginning
of the 16th century they seem to have practically come to an
end, although a few survivals of the custom of writing on wax
have lingered to modern times.</p>

<p>As already stated, the <i>codex</i>, or MS. in book-form, owed its
existence to the substitution of vellum for papyrus as the common
writing material for Greek and Roman literature. The
fact that vellum was a tough material capable of being
<span class="sidenote">The Codex.</span>
inscribed on both sides, that writing, particularly
if freshly written, could be easily washed off or erased from
it, and that the material could thus be made available for
second use, no doubt contributed largely to its ready adoption.
In Rome in the 1st century <span class="scs">B.C.</span> it was used, like the waxen tablets
for notes, drafts, memoranda, &amp;c.; and vellum tablets began to
take the place of the <i>cerae</i>. References are not wanting in the
classical writers to its employment for such temporary purposes.
To what extent it was at first pressed into the service of literature
and used in the preparation of books for the market must remain
uncertain. But in the first three centuries of our era it may be
assumed that vellum codices were not numerous. The papyrus
roll still held its position as the <i>liber</i> or book of literature. Yet
we learn from the poems of Martial that in his day the works of
some of the best classical authors were to be had on vellum.
From the way in which, in his <i>Apophoreta</i>, he has contrasted as
exchangeable gifts certain works written respectively on papyrus
and on vellum, it has been argued that vellum at that time was a
cheap material, inferior to papyrus, and only used for roughly
written copies. Up to a certain point this may be true, but the
fact that the earliest great vellum Greek codices of the Bible and
of Latin classical authors, dating back to the 4th century, are
composed of very finely prepared material would indicate a
perfection of manufacture of long standing.</p>

<p>But, apart from the references of writers, we have the results
of recent excavations in Egypt to enable us to form a more correct
judgment on the early history of the vellum codex. There have
been found a certain number of inscribed leaves and fragments
of vellum of early date which without doubt originally formed
part of codices or MSS. in book-form. It is true that they are not
numerous, but from the character of the writing certain of them
can be individually assigned to the 3rd, to the 2nd, and even to
the 1st century. We may then take it for an established fact
that the codex form of MS. was gradually thrusting its way into
use in the first centuries of our era.</p>

<p>The convenience of the codex form for easy reference was also
a special recommendation in its favour. There can be little
doubt that such compilations as public registers must at once
have been drawn up in the new form. The jurists also were
quick to adopt it, and the very title &ldquo;codex&rdquo; has been attached
to great legal compilations, such as those of Theodosius and
Justinian. Again, the book-form was favoured by the early
Christians. The Bible, the book which before all others became
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page621" id="page621"></a>621</span>
the great work of reference in their hands, could only be consulted
with convenience and despatch in the new form. A single
codex could hold the contents of a work which formerly must have
been distributed through many volumes in roll-form. The term
<span class="grk" title="sômation">&#963;&#969;&#956;&#940;&#964;&#953;&#959;&#957;</span>, which was one of the names given to a codex, was
expressive of its capacity. Turning again to discoveries in
Egypt, it appears that in the early centuries the codex-form had
become so usual among the Christians in that land that even the
native material, papyrus, the recognized material for the roll,
was now also made up by them into leaved books. The greater
number of papyri of the 3rd century containing Christian writings,
fragments of the Scriptures, the &ldquo;Sayings of Our Lord,&rdquo; and
the like, are in book-form. On the other hand, the large majority
of the non-Christian papyri of the same period keep to the old
roll-form. Thus the codex becomes at once identified with the
new religion, while the papyrus roll to the last is the chosen
vehicle of pagan literature.</p>

<p>In the 4th century the struggle between the roll and the codex
for supremacy in the literary field was finished, and the victory of
the codex was achieved. Henceforward the roll-form remained in
use for records and legal documents, and in certain instances for
liturgies; and for such purposes it survives to the present day.
But so completely was it superseded in literature by the codex
that even when papyrus, the material once identified with the
roll-form, was used as it sometimes was down to the 6th and 7th
centuries and later, it was made up into the leaved codex, not
only in Egypt but also in western Europe.</p>

<p>The shape which the codex usually assumed in the early centuries
of the middle ages was the broad quarto. The quires or
gatherings of which the book was formed generally
consisted, in the earliest examples, of four sheets
<span class="sidenote">Quires.</span>
folded to make eight leaves (<span class="grk" title="tetrás">&#964;&#949;&#964;&#961;&#940;&#962;</span> or <span class="grk" title="tetrádion">&#964;&#949;&#964;&#961;&#940;&#948;&#953;&#959;&#957;</span>, <i>quaternio</i>),
although occasionally quinterns, or quires of five sheets (ten
leaves), were adopted. Sexterns, or quires of six sheets
(twelve leaves), came into use at a later period. In
making up the quires, care was generally taken to lay the
sheets of vellum in such a way that hair-side faced hair-side,
and flesh-side faced flesh-side; so that, when the book
was opened, the two pages before the reader had the same appearance,
either the yellow tinge of the hair-side, or the fresh whiteness
of the flesh-side. In Greek MSS. the arrangement of the
sheets was afterwards reduced to a system; the first sheet was laid
with the flesh-side downwards, so that that side began the quire;
yet in so early an example as the Codex Alexandrinus the first
page of a quire is the hair-side. In Latin MSS. also the hair-side
appears generally to have formed the first page. When paper
came into general use for codices in the 15th century, it was not
an uncommon practice to give the paper quires additional
strength by an admixture of vellum, a sheet of the latter material
forming the outer leaves, and sometimes the middle leaves also,
of the quire. The quire mark, or &ldquo;signature,&rdquo; was usually
written at the foot of the last page, but in some early instances
(<i>e.g.</i> the Codex Alexandrinus) it appears at the head of the first
page of each quire. The numbering of the separate leaves in a
quire, in the fashion followed by early printers, came in in the
14th century. Catch-words to connect the quires appear first in
the 11th century and are not uncommon in the 12th century.</p>

<p>No exact system was followed in ruling the guiding lines on the
pages of the codex. In the case of papyri it was enough to mark
with the pencil the vertical marginal lines to bound
the text, if indeed even this was considered needful
<span class="sidenote">Ruling.</span>
(see above); the fibres of the papyrus were a sufficient guide
for the lines of writing. On vellum it became necessary to
rule lines to keep the writing even. These lines were at first
drawn with a blunt point, almost invariably on the hair (or outer)
side of the skin, and strongly enough to be in relief on the flesh
(or inner) side. Marginal lines were drawn to bound the text
laterally; but the ruled lines which guided the writing were not
infrequently drawn right across the sheet. Each sheet should
be ruled separately; but two or more sheets were often laid and
ruled together, the lines being drawn with so much force that the
lower sheets also received the impressions. In rare instances
lines are found ruled on both sides of the leaf, as in some parts of
the Codex Alexandrinus. In this same MS. and in other early
codices the ruling was not always drawn for every line of writing,
but was occasionally spaced so that the writing ran between the
ruled lines as well as on them. The lines were evenly spaced by
means of guiding pricks made at measured intervals with a
compass or rotary instrument down the margins; in some early
MSS. these pricks run down the middle of the page. Ruling
with the plummet or lead-point is found in the 11th century and
came into ordinary use in the 12th century; coloured inks, <i>e.g.</i> red
and violet, were used for ornamental ruling in the 15th century.</p>

<p><i>Mechanical Arrangement of Writing in MSS.</i>&mdash;It has already
been stated above that in the papyrus rolls the text was written
in columns. They stood with convenient intervals
between them and with fair margins at top and
<span class="sidenote">Columns.</span>
bottom. The length of the lines was to some extent governed
by the nature of the text. If it was a poetical work, the metrical
line was naturally the line of the column, unless, as sometimes
was the case, the verse was written continuously as prose. For
prose works a narrow column was preferred. It is noticeable
that the columns in papyri have a tendency to lean to the right
instead of being perpendicular&mdash;an indication that it was not the
practice to rule marginal lines. In codices the columnar arrangement
was also largely followed, and the number of columns in a
page was commonly two. There are instances, however, of a
larger number. The Codex Sinaiticus of the Bible has four
columns to the page; and the Codex Vaticanus, three columns.
And the tricolumnar arrangement occurs every now and then in
later MSS.</p>

<p>In both Greek and Latin literary MSS. of early date the writing
runs on continuously without separation of words. This practice
however, may be regarded as rather artificial, as in
papyri written in non-literary hands and in Latin
<span class="sidenote">Text without separation of Words.</span>
deeds also, contemporary with these early literary
MSS., there is a tendency to separation. In a text
thus continuously written occasional ambiguities necessarily
occurred, and then a dot or apostrophe might be inserted
between words to aid the reader. Following the system of
separation of words which appears in ancient inscriptions,
wherein the several words are marked off by single, double, or
treble dots or points, the words of the fragmentary poem on the
battle of Actium found at Herculaneum are separated by single
points, probably to facilitate reading aloud; monosyllables or
short prepositions and conjunctions, however, being left unseparated
from the words immediately following them&mdash;a system
which is found in practice at a later time. But such marks of
separation are not to be confounded with similar marks of punctuation
whereby sentences are marked off and the sense of the text
is made clear. Throughout the career of the uncial codices down
to the 6th century, continuity of text was maintained. In
the 7th century there is some evidence of separation of words,
but without system. In early Latin minuscule codices partial
separation in an uncertain and hesitating manner went on to the
time of the Carolingian reform. In early Irish and English MSS.,
however, separation is more consistently practised. In the 9th
and 10th centuries long words tend to separation, but short words,
prepositions and conjunctions, still cling to the following word.
It was not till the 11th century that the smaller words at length
stood apart, and systematic separation of words was established.
In Greek minuscule codices of the 10th century a certain degree
of separation takes place; yet a large proportion of words remain
linked together, and they are even incorrectly divided. Indeed
a correct system of distinct separation of words in Greek texts
was never thoroughly established even as late as the 15th
century.</p>

<p>But while distinction of words was disregarded in early
literary texts, distinction of important pauses in the sense was
recognized from the first. The papyrus of the <i>Persae</i>
of Timotheus of Miletus, the oldest MS. of a Greek
<span class="sidenote">Paragraphs.</span>
classic in existence, of the end of the 4th century <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, is written
in independent paragraphs. This is a natural system, the
simplicity of which has caused it to be the system of modern
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page622" id="page622"></a>622</span>
times. But, in addition, the Greek scribe also separated paragraphs
by inserting a short horizontal stroke, <span class="grk" title="parágraphos">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#940;&#947;&#961;&#945;&#966;&#959;&#962;</span>,
between them at the commencement of the lines of writing. It
should be noted that this stroke indicated the close of a passage,
and therefore belonged to the paragraph just concluded, and did
not stand for an initial sign for the new paragraph which followed.
The dividing stroke was also used to mark off the different
speeches of a play. Besides the stroke, a wedge-shaped sign
or tick might be used. But to make every paragraph stand
distinctly by itself would have entailed a certain loss of space.
If the concluding line were short, there would remain a long
space unfilled. Therefore, when this occurred, it became
customary to leave only a short space blank to mark the termination
of the paragraph, and then to proceed with the new
paragraph in the same line, the <span class="grk" title="parágraphos">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#940;&#947;&#961;&#945;&#966;&#959;&#962;</span> at the same time
preventing possible ambiguity. The next step was to project the
first letter of the first full line of the new paragraph slightly into
the margin, as a still further distinction; and lastly to enlarge it.
The enlargement of the letter gave it so much prominence that
the dividing stroke could then be dispensed with, and in this form
the new paragraph was henceforward indicated in Greek MSS.,
it being immaterial whether the enlarged letter was the initial
or a medial letter of a word. As early as the 5th century there
is evidence that the <span class="grk" title="parágraphos">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#940;&#947;&#961;&#945;&#966;&#959;&#962;</span> was losing its meaning with
the scribes, for in the Codex Alexandrinus of the Bible it is not
infrequently found in anomalous positions, particularly above
the initial letters of different books, as if it were a mere ornament.</p>

<p>In Latin MSS. there was no such fixed system of marking
off paragraphs as that just described. A new paragraph
began with a new line, or a brief space in a line separated the
conclusion of a paragraph from the beginning of the next one. It
was only by the ultimate introduction of large letters, as the
initial letters of the several sentences and paragraphs, and by
the establishment of a system of punctuation, in the modern
sense of the word, that a complete arrangement of the text
was possible into sentences and paragraphs in accordance
with its sense.</p>

<p>From the earliest times an elementary system of punctuation
by points is found in papyri. Thus the papyrus of the <i>Curse
of Artemisia</i>, at Vienna, which is at least as early
as the 3rd century <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, and in one or two other
<span class="sidenote">Punctuation.</span>
ancient examples, a double point, resembling the modern colon,
separates sentences. But more commonly a single point,
placed high in the line of writing, is employed. This single
punctuation was reduced to a system by the Alexandrian
grammarians, its invention being ascribed to Aristophanes
of Byzantium, 260 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> The point placed high on a level with
the top of the letters had the value of a full-stop; in the middle
of the line of writing, of a comma; and low down on the line, of
a semicolon. But these distinctions were not observed in the
MSS. In the early vellum codices both the high and the middle
point are found. In medieval MSS. other signs, coming nearer
to our modern system, make their appearance. In Latin MSS.
by the 7th century the high point has the value of the modern
comma, the semicolon appears with its present value, and a
point emphasized with additional signs, such as a second point
or point and dash, marks a full-stop. In the Carolingian period
the comma appears, as well as the inverted semicolon holding
a position between our comma and semicolon.</p>

<p>Another detail which required the scribe&rsquo;s attention in writing
his text was the division of the last word in a line, when for
want of room a portion of it had to be carried over
into the next line. It was preferable, indeed, to
<span class="sidenote">Division of Words at the End of a Line.</span>
avoid such division, and in the papyri as well as
in the codices letters might be reduced in size and
huddled together at the end of the line with this view.
In the early codices too it was a common practice to link
letters together in monogrammatic form, such as the common
verbal terminations <i>ur</i>, <i>unt</i>, and thus save space. But when
the division of a word was necessary, it was subject to certain
rules. According to the Greek practice the division was ordinarily
made after a vowel, as <span class="grk" title="etu|chon">&#7956;&#964;&#965;|&#967;&#959;&#957;</span> (even monosyllables
might be so treated, as <span class="grk" title="ou|k">&#959;&#8016;|&#954;</span>). But in the case of double
consonants the division fell after the first of them, as <span class="grk" title="ip|pos">&#7989;&#960;|&#960;&#959;&#962;</span>:
and, when the first of two or more consonants was a liquid
or nasal the division followed it, as <span class="grk" title="ophthal|mos">&#8000;&#966;&#952;&#945;&#955;|&#956;&#972;&#962;</span>, <span class="grk" title="man|thanô">&#956;&#945;&#957;|&#952;&#940;&#957;&#969;</span>. When
a word was compounded with a preposition, the division
usually followed the preposition, as <span class="grk" title="pros|eipon">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#962;|&#949;&#8150;&#960;&#959;&#957;</span>, but not
infrequently the normal practice of dividing after a vowel
prevailed, as <span class="grk" title="pro|seipon">&#960;&#961;&#959;|&#963;&#949;&#8150;&#960;&#959;&#957;</span>. In Latin the true syllabic
division was followed, but occasionally the scribes adopted
the Greek system and divided after a vowel.</p>

<p>A modification of the practice of writing the text continuously
was allowed in the case of certain works. Rhetorical texts,
such as the orations of Demosthenes and Cicero,
and the text of the Bible, might be broken up into
<span class="sidenote">Colometry.</span>
short clauses or sense-lines, apparently with the view of assisting
reading aloud. Instances of MSS. so written are still extant.
This system, to which the name of &ldquo;colometry&rdquo; has been
given, is the arrangement by <i>cola</i> and <i>commata</i> referred to by
St Jerome in his preface to Isaiah. It will be found more fully
explained under the heading of <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Stichometry</a></span>; where also is
described the mechanical computation of the length of a text
by measured lines, for the purpose <span class="correction" title="amended from or">of</span> calculating the pay of
the scribe.</p>

<p>The title of a MS., both in roll-form and in codex-form, was
frequently written at the end of the text, but even at an early
date it stood in some instances at the beginning;
and the latter practice in course of time prevailed,
<span class="sidenote">Titles and Colophons.</span>
although even in the 15th century the title was
sometimes reserved for the close of the MS. In this latter
position it might stand alone or be accompanied by other
particulars concerning the MS., such as the length of the work,
the date of writing, the name of the scribe, &amp;c., all combined
in a final paragraph called the colophon. For distinction, title
and colophon might be written in red, as might also the first
few lines of the text. This method of rubrication was a very
early practice, appearing even in ancient Egyptian papyri.
Such rubrics and titles and colophons were at first written in
the same character as the text; afterwards, when the admixture
of different kinds of writing was allowed, capitals and uncials
were used at discretion. Running titles or head-lines are found
in some of the earliest Latin MSS. in the same characters as
the text, but of a small size. Quotations were usually indicated
<span class="sidenote">Quotations.</span>
by ticks or arrow-heads in the margin, serving the
purpose of the modern inverted commas. Sometimes
the quoted words were arranged as a sub-paragraph
or indented passage. In commentaries of later date, the quotations
from the work commented upon were often written in a
different style from the text of the commentary itself.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Accentuation, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;Accentuation was not systematically applied
to Greek MSS. before the 7th century, but even in the literary papyri
it appears occasionally. In the latter instances accents were applied
specially to assist the reader, and they seem to have been used more
frequently in texts which may have presented greater difficulties
than usual. For example, they are found fairly plentifully in the
papyrus of Bacchylides of the 1st century <span class="scs">B.C.</span> In the less well-written
papyri they are fewer in number; and papyri written in non-literary
hands are practically devoid of them. Accents have been
frequently added to the ancient texts of Homer, as in the Harris and
Bankes papyri, but apparently long after the date of the writing.
They were not used in the early uncial MSS. Breathings also appear
occasionally in the papyri. The rough and the smooth breathings
are found in the form of the two halves of the H (<img style="width:16px; height:18px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img622a.jpg" alt="" />) in the Bacchylides
papyrus; in other papyri they are in rectangular form, never
rounded like an apostrophe; in fact rounded breathings do not come
into general use until the 12th century. Other signs resembling
accents are used occasionally in Greek MSS. For example, a short
accent or horizontal stroke was employed to indicate a single-letter
word, and an apostrophe was sometimes used to separate words in
order to prevent ambiguity and was placed after words ending in
&kappa;, &chi;, &xi;, &rho;, and after proper names not having a Greek termination.</p>

<p>Accents were seldom employed by Latin scribes. In early Irish
and English MSS., in particular, an acute accent is occasionally
found over a monosyllabic word or one consisting of a single letter.
In the 9th and 10th centuries a curious occasional practice obtained
among the correctors of the texts of expressing the aspirate by the
Greek half-eta symbol <img style="width:12px; height:15px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img622b.jpg" alt="" />, instead of writing the letter <i>h</i> in the ordinary
way&mdash;perhaps only an affectation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page623" id="page623"></a>623</span></p>

<p><i>Corrections.</i>&mdash;For obliteration or removing pen strokes from the
surface of the material the sponge was used in ancient times. While
the writing was still fresh, the scribe could easily wash off the ink
by this means; and for a fragile material, such as papyrus, he could
well use no other. On vellum he might use sponge or knife. But
after a MS. had left his hands it would undergo revision at the hands
of a corrector, who had to deal with the text in a different manner.
He could no longer conveniently apply the sponge. On hard material
he might still use the knife to erase letters or words or sentences. But
he could also use his pen for such purposes. Thus we find that a very
early system of indicating erasure was the placing of dots or minute
strokes above the letters to be thus &ldquo;expunged.&rdquo; The same marks
were also (and generally at later periods) placed under the letters;
in rare instances they stood inside them. It need scarcely be said
that letters were also struck out with strokes of the pen or altered
into others, and that letters and words were interlined. A long
sentence, however, which could not be admitted between the lines,
was entered in the margin, and its place in the text indicated by
corresponding reference marks, such as <i>hd.</i>, <i>hs.</i> = <i>hic deest</i>, <i>hoc supra</i>
or <i>hic scribas</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Abbreviations and Contractions.</i>&mdash;The practice of shortening words
in writing has played an important part in the history of the ancient
and the medieval manuscript. Two reasons have disposed men to
follow this practice: firstly, the desire to avoid the labour of writing
over and over again words or portions of words of common occurrence
which can be readily understood in a shortened form as when written
in full; and, secondly, the necessity of saving space at a time when
it was an object to make the most of the writing material to hand.
To meet the former requirement, a simple and limited method alone
was needed; to satisfy the second, a more elaborate system was
necessary. The most natural method of reducing the length of a
word is to suppress as much as possible of its termination, consistently
with intelligibility, that is, by simple <i>abbreviation</i>. But if
space of any appreciable value is to be saved in a page of writing, a
system is necessary for eliminating letters from the body of the word
as well as curtailing the termination, that is, a system of <i>contraction</i>
as well as abbreviation; and, in addition, the employment of arbitrary
signs, analogous to shorthand, will serve still further to condense the
text. An elaborate system of contraction of this nature was naturally
only fully developed after very long practice. Both in Greek
and in Latin MSS. from the 9th to the 15th century such a system
was in full force.</p>

<p>Different kinds of literature were, according to their nature, more
or less abbreviated and contracted. From early times such curtailment
was more freely employed in works written in technical
language, such as works on law or grammar or mathematics, wherein
particular words are more liable to repetition, than in MSS. of general
literature. The oldest system of abbreviation is that in which a
single letter (nearly always the initial letter) or at most two or three
letters represent the whole word. This system we know was in
common use among both Greek and Latin writers, and ancient
inscriptions afford plentiful examples. It is well adapted for the
brief expression of the common words and phrases in works of a
technical nature (as for example such a phrase as C&nbsp;D&nbsp;E&nbsp;R&nbsp;N&nbsp;E =
<i>cujus de ea re notio est</i>); but for general literature it is of little use, and
practically has been restricted to express proper names and numerals.</p>

<p>When abbreviations were employed only with the view of speed
in writing, it is obvious that they would occur more frequently in
the ephemeral documents of daily life than in carefully
written literary works intended for the book-market.
<span class="sidenote">Abbreviation in Greek MSS.</span>
Hence they are not to be found in Greek papyri of the
latter class. On the other hand in literary papyri
written in non-literary script they naturally occur just as they would
in contemporary common documents. As early as the 3rd and
2nd centuries <span class="scs">B.C.</span> the ordinary method of abbreviation was to omit
the termination or latter portion of the word and to mark the
omission by a short horizontal stroke or dash; or the letter which
immediately preceded the omission was written above the line as a
key to the reading, as <span class="grk" title="te^l">&#964;&#949;<span class="sp">&#955;</span></span> for <span class="grk" title="télos">&#964;&#941;&#955;&#959;&#962;</span>. Such a system obviously might
be extended indefinitely at the discretion of the writer. But in
addition, at quite an early period, symbols and monogrammatic
forms for particular words must have been developed, for they are
found in common use in cursive papyri. A notable instance of their
employment in a full degree occurs in the papyrus of Aristotle&rsquo;s
<i>Constitution of Athens</i>, of the 1st century.</p>

<p>Like the well-written literary papyri, the early vellum uncial
codices of the Bible, being inscribed with calligraphic formality,
avoided in principle the use of abbreviations. But by the 4th to
the 6th century, the period when they were chiefly produced, the
contraction or abbreviation of certain words and terminations had,
it seems, become so fixed by usage that the contracted forms were
adopted in the texts. They are <span class="grk" title="ThS"><span class="ov">&#920;C</span></span> = <span class="grk" title="theos">&#952;&#949;&#972;&#962;</span>, <span class="grk" title="IS"><span class="ov">&#921;C</span></span> = <span class="grk" title="iêsous">&#943;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span>, <span class="grk" title="ChS"><span class="ov">&#935;C</span></span> = <span class="grk" title="christos">&#967;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#972;&#962;</span>,

<span class="grk" title="T">&#932;</span> = <span class="grk" title="tai">&#964;&#945;&#953;</span>, <span class="grk" title="M">&#924;</span> = <span class="grk" title="mou">&#956;&#959;&#965;</span>, <span class="grk" title="moi">&#956;&#959;&#953;</span>, &amp;c. Final &Nu;, especially at the end of a line, was
dropped, and its place occupied by the horizontal stroke, as <span class="grk" title="TO">&#932;&#927;</span><span class="ov">&emsp;</span>.</p>

<p>But while this limited system was used in biblical, and also in
liturgical MSS., in profane literature a greater licence was recognized.
For example, in a fragment of a mathematical work at Milan, of the
7th century, we find instances of abbreviation by dropping terminations,
just as in the earlier papyri, and, in addition, contracted
particles and prepositions are numerous. Technical works, in fact,
inherited the system instituted in the early papyri written in non-literary
or cursive hands; and this system, undergoing continual
development, had a larger scope when the cursive writing was cast
into a literary form and became the literary minuscule script of the
middle ages. From the 9th century onwards a fully developed system
of abbreviation and contraction was practised in Greek MSS.,
comprising the early system of the papyri, the special contractions of
the early biblical MSS., and also a large number of special symbols,
derived in great measure from tachygraphical signs.</p>

<p>In the early Greek minuscule MSS. contractions are not very frequent
in the texts; but in the marginal glosses, where it was an object
to save space, they are found in great numbers as early as the 10th
century. The MS. of Nonnus, of <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 972, in the British Museum
(Wattenb. and Von Vels., <i>Exempla</i>, 7) is an instance of a text contracted
to a degree that almost amounts to tachygraphy. In the
12th, 13th and 14th centuries texts were fully contracted; and as
the writing became more cursive contraction-marks were more carelessly
applied, until, in the 15th century, they degenerated into mere
flourishes.</p>

<p>As far back as material is available for comparison, it appears that
abbreviations and contractions in Latin MSS. followed the same lines
as those in Greek MSS. We have no very early papyri
written in Latin as we have in Greek to show us what
<span class="sidenote">Abbreviations in Latin MSS.</span>
the practice of Roman writers was in the 3rd and 2nd
and early 1st centuries <span class="scs">B.C.</span>; but there can be little doubt
that in that remote time there was followed in Latin writing a
system of abbreviation similar to that in Greek, that is, by curtailment
of terminations, and that in ephemeral documents written in
cursive characters such abbreviation was allowed more freely than in
carefully written literary works. The early system of representing
words by their initial letters has already been referred to. It was
in common use, as we know, in the inscriptions on coins and monuments,
and to some extent in the texts of Roman writers. But the
ambiguity which must have always accompanied such a system
of single-letter abbreviations, or <i>sigla</i>, naturally induced an improvement
by expressing a word by two or more of its letters. Hence was
developed the more regular syllabic system of the Romans, by which
the leading letters of the several syllables were written, as EG =
<i>ergo</i>, H<span class="ov">R</span> = <i>heres</i>, S<span class="ov">T</span> = <i>satis</i>. At a later time Christian writers
secured greater exactness by expressing the final letter of a contracted
word, as <i>d<span class="ov">s</span></i> = <i>deus</i>, <i>d&#333;</i> = <i>deo</i>, <i>scs</i> = <i>sanctus</i>. Further, certain marks
and signs, many derived from shorthand symbols, came into use to
indicate inflections and terminations; or the terminating letter or a
leading letter to indicate the termination might be written above
the line, as Q<span class="sp">o</span> = <i>quo</i>, V<span class="sp">m</span> = <i>verum</i>, N<span class="sp">o</span> = <i>noster</i>, S<span class="sp">i</span> = <i>sint</i>. This practice
became capable of greater development later on. Among the special
signs are <span class="ov">c</span> = <i>est</i>, <img style="width:13px; height:19px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img623a.jpg" alt="" /> = <i>vel</i>, <i><span class="ov">n</span></i> = <i>non</i>, p&rsquo; = <i>pre</i>, <img style="width:13px; height:17px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img623b.jpg" alt="" /> = <i>per</i>, <img style="width:16px; height:16px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img623c.jpg" alt="" /> = <i>pro</i>, <span class="sp">9</span> = termination
<i>us</i>. The letter <i>q</i> with distinctive strokes applied in different
positions represented the often recurring relative and other short
words, as <i>quod</i>, <i>quia</i>.</p>

<p>In Latin Biblical uncial MSS. the same restrictions on abbreviations
were exercised as in the Greek. The sacred names and titles
<span class="ov">DS</span> = <i>deus</i>, <span class="ov">DM</span>S, D<span class="ov">N</span>S = <i>dominus</i>, S<span class="ov">C</span>S = <i>sanctus</i>, <span class="ov">SPS</span> = <i>spiritus</i>, and
others appear in the oldest codices. The contracted terminations
Q· = <i>que</i>, B· = <i>bus</i>, and the omission of final <i>m</i>, or (more rarely) final
<i>n</i>, are common to all Latin MSS. of the earliest period. There is a
peculiarity about the contracted form of our Saviour&rsquo;s name that it
is always written by the Latin scribes in letters imitating the Greek
I<span class="ov">HC</span>, X<span class="ov">PC</span>, <i><span class="ov">ihc</span></i>, <i><span class="ov">xpc</span></i>, and <i><span class="ov">ihs</span></i>, <i><span class="ov">xps</span></i>.</p>

<p>The full development of the medieval system of abbreviation and
contraction was effected at the time when the Carolingian schools
were compelling the reform of the handwriting of western Europe.
Then came a freer practice of abbreviation by suppression of terminations
and the latter portions of words, the omission of which was
indicated by the ordinary signs, the horizontal or oblique stroke or the
apostrophe; then came also a freer practice of contraction by omitting
letters and syllables from the middle as well as the end of words,
as <span class="ov">oio</span>, <i>omnino</i>, <span class="ov">prb</span>, <i>presbyter</i>; and then from the practice of writing
above the line a leading letter of an omitted syllable, as int<span class="sp">a</span> = <i>intra</i>,
t<span class="sp">r</span> = <i>tur</i>, conventional signs, with special significations, were also
gradually developed. Such growths are well illustrated in the change
undergone by the semicolon, which was attached to the end of a word
to indicate the omission of the termination, as b; = <i>bus</i>, q; = <i>que</i>,
deb; = <i>debet</i>, and which in course of time became converted into
a z, a form which survives in our ordinary abbreviation, viz. (<i>i.e.</i>
vi; = <i>videlicet</i>). The different forms of contraction were common
to all the nations of western Europe. The Spanish scribes, however,
attached different values to certain of them. For example, in
Visigothic MSS., <i><span class="ov">qm</span></i>, which elsewhere represented <i>quoniam</i>, may be
read as <i>quum</i>; and <img style="width:16px; height:16px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img623c.jpg" alt="" />, which elsewhere = <i>pro</i>, is here = <i>per</i>. Nor
must the use of arbitrary symbols for special words be forgotten.
These are generally adaptations of the shorthand signs known as
Tironian notes. Such are <img style="width:15px; height:15px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img623d.jpg" alt="" /> = <i>autem</i>, ÷ = <i>est</i>, <img style="width:16px; height:18px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img623e.jpg" alt="" /> = <i>ejus</i>, <img style="width:15px; height:18px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img623f.jpg" alt="" /> = <i>enim</i>,
<img style="width:15px; height:14px; vertical-align: middle;" src="images/img623g.jpg" alt="" /> = <i>et</i>, v&#775; and u&#775; = <i>ut</i>, which were employed particularly in early MSS. of
English and Irish origin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page624" id="page624"></a>624</span></p>

<p>By the 11th century the system of Latin contractions had been
reduced to exact rules; and from this time onwards it was universally
practised. It reached its culminating point in the 13th century,
the period of increasing demand for MSS., when it became more than
ever necessary to economize space. After this date the exact formation
of the signs of contractions was less strictly observed, and the
system deteriorated together with the decline of handwriting. In
conclusion, it may be noticed that in MSS. written in the vernacular
tongues contractions are more rarely used than in Latin texts.
A system suited to the inflexions and terminations of this language
could not be readily adapted to other languages so different in
grammatical structure.</p>

<p><i>Palimpsests, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;Palimpsest MSS., that is, MSS. written upon
material from which older writing has been previously removed by
washing or scraping, are described in a separate article (<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Palimpsest</a></span>).
The ornamentation of MSS. is fully dealt with under the headings
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Illuminated MSS.</a></span>, and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Miniatures</a></span>.</p>

<p><i>Writing Implements.</i>&mdash;In conclusion, a few words may be added
respecting the writing implements employed in the production of
MSS. The reed, <span class="grk" title="kalamos">&#954;&#940;&#955;&#945;&#956;&#959;&#962;</span>, <i>calamus</i>, was adapted for tracing characters
either on papyrus or vellum. By the ancient Egyptians, and also
probably by the early Greek scribes in Egypt, it was used with a soft
brush-like point, rather as a paint-brush than as a pen. The Greek
and Roman scribes used the reed cut to a point and slit like the quill-pen;
and it survived as a writing implement into the middle ages.
For scratching letters on the waxen tablet the sharp pointed bodkin,
<span class="grk" title="stylos">&#963;&#964;&#8166;&#955;&#959;&#962;</span>, <span class="grk" title="grapheion">&#947;&#961;&#945;&#966;&#949;&#8150;&#959;&#957;</span>, <i>stilus</i>, <i>graphium</i>, was necessary, made of iron,
bronze, ivory, or other suitable material, with a knobbed or flattened
butt-end wherewith corrections could be made by smoothening the
wax surface (hence <i>vertere stilum</i>, to correct). Although there is no
very early record of the use of quills as pens, it is obvious that, well
adapted as they are for the purpose and to be had everywhere, they
must have been in request even in ancient times as they afterwards
were in the middle ages. Bronze pens, fashioned exactly on the
model of the quill-pen, that is in form of a tube ending in a slit nib
(sometimes even with a nib at each end), of late Roman manufacture,
are still in existence. A score of them are to be found scattered
among public and private museums. The ruler for guiding
ruled lines was the <span class="grk" title="kanôn">&#954;&#945;&#957;&#974;&#957;</span>, <i>canon</i>, <i>regula</i>; the pencil was the <span class="grk" title="molubdos">&#956;&#972;&#955;&#965;&#946;&#948;&#959;&#962;</span>,
<i>plumbum</i>, the plummet; the pricker for marking the spacing out of
the ruled lines was the <span class="grk" title="diabatês">&#948;&#953;&#945;&#946;&#940;&#964;&#951;&#962;</span>, <i>circinus</i>, <i>punctorium</i>; the pen-knife,
<span class="grk" title="glyphanon">&#947;&#955;&#973;&#966;&#945;&#957;&#959;&#957;</span>, <span class="grk" title="smilê">&#963;&#956;&#943;&#955;&#951;</span>, <i>scalprum</i>; the erasing-knife, <i>rasorium</i>, <i>novacula</i>.</p>

<p><i>Inks.</i>&mdash;Inks of various colours were employed from early times.
The ink of the early papyri is a deep glossy black; in the Byzantine
period it deteriorates. In the middle ages black ink is generally of
excellent quality; it tends to deteriorate from the 14th century.
But its quality varies in different countries at different periods.
Red ink, besides being used for titles and colophons, also served for
contrast, as, for example, in glosses. In the Carolingian period
entire MSS. were occasionally written in red ink. Other coloured
inks&mdash;green, violet and yellow&mdash;are also found, at an early date.
Gold and silver writing fluids were used in the texts of the ancient
purple vellum MSS., and writing in gold was reintroduced under
Charlemagne for codices of ordinary white vellum. It was introduced
into English MSS. in the 10th century.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MANUTIUS,<a name="ar175" id="ar175"></a></span> the Latin name of an Italian family (Mannucci,
Manuzio), famous in the history of printing as organizers of
the Aldine press.</p>

<p>1. <span class="sc">Aldus Manutius</span> (1450-1515). Teobaldo Mannucci,
better known as Aldo Manuzio, the founder of the Aldine press,
was born in 1450 at Sermoneta in the Papal States. He received
a scholar&rsquo;s training, studying Latin at Rome under Gasparino
da Verona, and Greek at Ferrara under Guarino da Verona. In
1482 he went to reside at Mirandola with his old friend and fellow-student,
the illustrious Giovanni Pico. There he stayed two
years, prosecuting his studies in Greek literature. Before Pico
removed to Florence, he procured for Aldo the post of tutor
to his nephews Alberto and Lionello Pio, princes of Carpi.
Alberto Pio supplied Aldo with funds for starting his printing
press, and gave him lands at Carpi. It was Aldo&rsquo;s ambition
to secure the literature of Greece from further accident by committing
its chief masterpieces to type. Before his time four
Italian towns had won the honours of Greek publications:
Milan, with the grammar of Lascaris, Aesop, Theocritus, a
Greek Psalter, and Isocrates, between 1476 and 1493; Venice,
with the <i>Erotemala</i> of Chrysoloras in 1484; Vicenza, with reprints
of Lascaris&rsquo;s grammar and the <i>Erolemata</i>, in 1488 and 1490;
Florence, with Alopa&rsquo;s Homer, in 1488. Of these works, only
three, the Milanese Theocritus and Isocrates and the Florentine
Homer, were classics. Aldo selected Venice as the most appropriate
station for his labours. He settled there in 1490, and
soon afterwards gave to the world editions of the <i>Hero and
Leander</i> of Musaeus, the <i>Galeomyomachia</i>, and the Greek Psalter.
These have no date; but they are the earliest tracts issued from
his press, and are called by him &ldquo;Precursors of the Greek
Library.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At Venice Aldo gathered an army of Greek scholars and compositors
around him. His trade was carried on by Greeks, and
Greek was the language of his household. Instructions to type-setters
and binders were given in Greek. The prefaces to his
editions were written in Greek. Greeks from Crete collated MSS.,
read proofs, and gave models of calligraphy for casts of Greek
type. Not counting the craftsmen employed in merely manual
labour, Aldo entertained as many as thirty of these Greek
assistants in his family. His own industry and energy were
unremitting. In 1495 he issued the first volume of his Aristotle.
Four more volumes completed the work in 1497-1498. Nine
comedies of Aristophanes appeared in 1498. Thucydides,
Sophocles and Herodotus followed in 1502; Xenophon&rsquo;s <i>Hellenics</i>
and Euripides in 1503; Demosthenes in 1504. The troubles of
Italy, which pressed heavily on Venice at this epoch, suspended
Aldo&rsquo;s labours for a while. But in 1508 he resumed his series
with an edition of the minor Greek orators; and in 1509 appeared
the lesser works of Plutarch. Then came another stoppage.
The league of Cambray had driven Venice back to her lagoons,
and all the forces of the republic were concentrated on a struggle
to the death with the allied powers of Europe. In 1513 Aldo
reappeared with Plato, which he dedicated to Leo X. in a preface
eloquently and earnestly comparing the miseries of warfare and
the woes of Italy with the sublime and tranquil objects of the
student&rsquo;s life. Pindar, Hesychius, and Athenaeus followed in
1514.</p>

<p>These complete the list of Aldo&rsquo;s prime services to Greek
literature. But it may be well in this place to observe that
his successors continued his work by giving Pausanias, Strabo,
Aeschylus, Galen, Hippocrates and Longinus to the world
in first editions. Omission has been made of Aldo&rsquo;s reprints,
in order that the attention of the reader might be concentrated
on his labours in editing Greek classics from MSS. Other presses
were at work in Italy; and, as the classics issued from Florence,
Rome or Milan, Aldo took them up, bestowing in each case
fresh industry upon the collation of codices and the correction
of texts. Nor was the Aldine press idle in regard to Latin
and Italian classics. The <i>Asolani</i> of Bembo, the collected
writings of Poliziano, the <i>Hypnerotomachia Poliphili</i>, Dante&rsquo;s
<i>Divine Comedy</i>, Petrarch&rsquo;s poems, a collection of early Latin
poets of the Christian era, the letters of the younger Pliny,
the poems of Pontanus, Sannazzaro&rsquo;s <i>Arcadia</i>, Quintilian,
Valerius Maximus, and the <i>Adagia</i> of Erasmus were printed,
either in first editions, or with a beauty of type and paper never
reached before, between the years 1495 and 1514. For these
Italian and Latin editions Aldo had the elegant type struck
which bears his name. It is said to have been copied from
Petrarch&rsquo;s handwriting, and was cast under the direction of
Francesco da Bologna, who has been identified by Panizzi with
Francia the painter.</p>

<p>Aldo&rsquo;s enthusiasm for Greek literature was not confined to
the printing-room. Whatever the students of this century
may think of his scholarship, they must allow that only vast
erudition and thorough familiarity with the Greek language
could have enabled him to accomplish what he did. In his
own days Aldo&rsquo;s learning won the hearty acknowledgment of
ripe scholars. To his fellow workers he was uniformly generous,
free from jealousy, and prodigal of praise. While aiming at
that excellence of typography which renders his editions the
treasures of the book-collector, he strove at the same time to
make them cheap. We may perhaps roughly estimate the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page625" id="page625"></a>625</span>
current price of his pocket series of Greek, Latin and Italian
classics, begun in 1501, at 2s. per volume of our present money.
The five volumes of the Aristotle cost about £8. His great
undertaking was carried on under continual difficulties, arising
from strikes among his workmen, the piracies of rivals, and the
interruptions of war. When he died, bequeathing Greek
literature as an inalienable possession to the world, he was a
poor man. In order to promote Greek studies, Aldo founded an
academy of Hellenists in 1500 under the title of the New Academy.
Its rules were written in Greek. Its members were obliged to
speak Greek. Their names were Hellenized, and their official
titles were Greek. The biographies of all the famous men
who were enrolled in this academy must be sought in the pages
of Didot&rsquo;s <i>Alde Manuce</i>. It is enough here to mention that
they included Erasmus and the English Linacre.</p>

<p>In 1499 Aldo married Maria, daughter of Andrea Torresano
of Asola. Andrea had already bought the press established
by Nicholas Jenson at Venice. Therefore Aldo&rsquo;s marriage combined
two important publishing firms. Henceforth the names
Aldus and Asolanus were associated on the title pages of the
Aldine publications; and after Aldo&rsquo;s death in 1515, Andrea
and his two sons carried on the business during the minority
of Aldo&rsquo;s children. The device of the dolphin and the anchor,
and the motto <i>festina lente</i>, which indicated quickness combined
with firmness in the execution of a great scheme, were never
wholly abandoned by the Aldines until the expiration of their
firm in the third generation.</p>

<p>2. <span class="sc">Paulus Manutius</span> (1512-1574). By his marriage with
Maria Torresano, Aldo had three sons, the youngest of whom,
Paolo, was born in 1512. He had the misfortune to lose his
father at the age of two. After this event his grandfather
and two uncles, the three Asolani, carried on the Aldine press,
while Paolo prosecuted his early studies at Venice. Excessive
application hurt his health, which remained weak during the
rest of his life. At the age of twenty-one he had acquired a
solid reputation for scholarship and learning. In 1533 Paolo
undertook the conduct of his father&rsquo;s business, which had latterly
been much neglected by his uncles. In the interregnum between
Aldo&rsquo;s death and Paolo&rsquo;s succession (1514-1533) the Asolani
continued to issue books, the best of which were Latin classics.
But, though their publications count a large number of first
editions, and some are works of considerable magnitude, they
were not brought out with the scholarly perfection at which
Aldo aimed. The Asolani attempted to perform the whole
duties of editing, and to reserve all its honours for themselves,
dispensing with the service of competent collaborators. The
result was that some of their editions, especially their Aeschylus
of 1518, are singularly bad. Paolo determined to restore the
glories of the house, and in 1540 he separated from his uncles.
The field of Greek literature having been well-nigh exhausted, he
devoted himself principally to the Latin classics. He was a
passionate Ciceronian, and perhaps his chief contributions to
scholarship are the corrected editions of Cicero&rsquo;s letters and
orations, his own epistles in a Ciceronian style, and his Latin
version of Demosthenes. Throughout his life he combined
the occupations of a student and a printer, winning an even
higher celebrity in the former field than his father had done.
Four treatises from his pen on Roman antiquities deserve to
be commemorated for their erudition no less than for the elegance
of their Latinity. Several Italian cities contended for the
possession of so rare a man; and he received tempting offers
from the Spanish court. Yet his life was a long struggle with
pecuniary difficulties. To prepare correct editions of the
classics, and to print them in a splendid style, has always been
a costly undertaking. And, though Paolo&rsquo;s publications were
highly esteemed, their sale was slow. In 1556 he received for
a time external support from the Venetian Academy, founded
by Federigo Badoaro. But Badoaro failed disgracefully in
1559, and the academy was extinct in 1562. Meanwhile Paolo
had established his brother, Antonio, a man of good parts but
indifferent conduct, in a printing office and book shop at Bologna.
Antonio died in 1559, having been a source of trouble and
expense to Paolo during the last four years of his life. Other
pecuniary embarrassments arose from a contract for supplying
fish to Venice, into which Paolo had somewhat strangely entered
with the government. In 1561 pope Pius IV. invited him to
Rome, offering him a yearly stipend of 500 ducats, and undertaking
to establish and maintain his press there. The profits
on publications were to be divided between Paolo Manuzio
and the Apostolic camera. Paolo accepted the invitation, and
spent the larger portion of his life, under three papacies, with
varying fortunes, in the city of Rome. Ill-health, the commercial
interests he had left behind at Venice, and the coldness shown
him by pope Pius V., induced him at various times and for
several reasons to leave Rome. As was natural, his editions
after his removal to Rome were mostly Latin works of theology
and Biblical or patristic literature.</p>

<p>Paolo married Caterina Odoni in 1546. She brought him
three sons and one daughter. His eldest son, the younger
Aldus, succeeded him in the management of the Venetian
printing house when his father settled at Rome in 1561. Paolo
had never been a strong man, and his health was overtaxed
with studies and commercial worries. Yet he lived into his
sixty-second year, and died at Rome in 1574.</p>

<p>3. <span class="sc">Aldus Manutius</span>, <span class="sc">Junior</span> (1547-1597). The younger
Aldo born in the year after his father Paolo&rsquo;s marriage, proved
what is called an infant prodigy. When he was nine years
old his name was placed upon the title page of the famous
<i>Eleganze della lingua Toscana e Latina</i>. The <i>Eleganze</i> was
probably a book made for his instruction and in his company
by his father. In 1561, at the age of fourteen, he produced a
work upon Latin spelling, called <i>Orthographiae ratio</i>. During
a visit to his father at Rome in the next year he was able to
improve this treatise by the study of inscriptions, and in 1575
he completed his labours in the same field by the publication
of an <i>Epitome orthographiae</i>. Whether Aldo was the sole
composer of the work on spelling, in its first edition, may be
doubted; but he appropriated the subject and made it his own.
Probably his greatest service to scholarship is this analysis
of the principles of orthography in Latin.</p>

<p>Aldo remained at Venice, studying literature and superintending
the Aldine press. In 1572 he married Francesca Lucrezia
daughter of Bartolommeo Giunta, and great-grandchild of the
first Giunta, who founded the famous printing house in Venice.
This was an alliance which augured well of the Giunta for the
future of the Aldines, especially as Aldo had recently found time
to publish a new revised edition of Velleius Paterculus. Two
years later the death of his father at Rome placed Aldo at the
head of the firm. In concert with the Giunta, he now edited
an extensive collection of Italian letters, and in 1576 he published
his commentary upon the <i>Ars poetica</i> of Horace. About the
same time, that is to say, about the year 1576, he was appointed
professor of literature to the Cancelleria at Venice. The Aldine
press continued through this period to issue books, but none
of signal merit; and in 1585 Aldo determined to quit his native
city for Bologna, where he occupied the chair of eloquence for
a few months. In 1587 he left Bologna for Pisa, and there,
in his quality of professor, he made the curious mistake of
printing Alberti&rsquo;s comedy <i>Philodoxius</i> as a work of the classic
Lepidus. Sixtus V. drew him in 1588 from Tuscany to Rome;
and at Rome he hoped to make a permanent settlement as
lecturer. But his public lessons were ill attended, and he soon
fell back upon his old vocation of publisher under the patronage
of a new pope, Clement VIII. In 1597 he died, leaving children,
but none who cared or had capacity to carry on the Aldine
press. Aldo himself, though a precocious student, a scholar
of no mean ability, and a publisher of some distinction, was
the least remarkable of the three men who gave books to the
public under the old Aldine ensign. This does not of necessity
mean that we should adopt Scaliger&rsquo;s critique of the younger
Aldo without reservation. Scaliger called him &ldquo;a poverty-stricken
talent, slow in operation; his work is very commonplace;
he aped his father.&rdquo; What is true in this remark lies partly
in the fact that scholarship in Aldo&rsquo;s days had flown beyond
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page626" id="page626"></a>626</span>
the Alps, where a new growth of erudition, on a basis different
from that of the Italian Renaissance, had begun.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MANWARING, ROBERT,<a name="ar176" id="ar176"></a></span> English 18th-century furniture
designer and cabinet maker. The dates of his birth and death
are unknown. He was a contemporary and imitator of Chippendale,
and not the least considerable of his rivals. He prided
himself upon work which he described as &ldquo;genteel,&rdquo; and his
speciality was chairs. He manifests the same surprising variations
of quality that are noticed in the work of nearly all the
English cabinet-makers of the second half of the 18th century,
and while his best had an undeniable elegance his worst was
exceedingly bad&mdash;squat, ill-proportioned and confused. Some
of his chairbacks are so nearly identical with Chippendale&rsquo;s that
it is difficult to suppose that the one did not copy from the other,
and most of the designs of the greater man enjoyed priority
of date. During a portion of his career Manwaring was a
devotee of the Chinese taste; he likewise practised in the Gothic
manner. He appears to have introduced the small bracket
between the front rail of the seat and the top of the chair leg,
or at all events to have made such constant use of it that it
has come to be regarded as characteristic of his work. Manwaring
described certain of his own work as &ldquo;elegant and
superb,&rdquo; and as possessing &ldquo;grandeur and magnificence.&rdquo; He
did not confine himself to furniture but produced many designs
for rustic gates and railings, often very extravagant. One of
his most absurd rural chairs has rock-work with a waterfall
in the back.</p>

between the lower river Don and the Caspian Sea, through
the Don Cossacks territory and between the government
of Astrakhan on the N. and that of Stavropol on the S.
During the greater part of the year it is either dry or occupied
in part by a string of saline lakes (<i>limans</i> or <i>ilmens</i>); but in
spring when the streams swell which empty into it, the water
flows in two opposite directions from the highest point (near
Shara-Khulusun). The western stream flows westwards, with
an inclination northwards, until it reaches the Don, though
when the latter river is running high, its water penetrates some
60 miles up the Manych. The eastern stream dies away in
the sandy steppe about 25 miles from the Caspian, though it
is said sometimes to reach the Kuma through the Huiduk, a
tributary of the Kuma. Total length of the depression, 330 m.
For its significance as a former (geologic) connexion between

and on the railways from Madrid to Ciudad Real and Lináres.
Pop. (1900), 11,229. Manzanares is one of the chief towns
of La Mancha, and thus in the centre of the district described
by Cervantes in <i>Don Quixote</i>. Its citadel was founded as a
Christian fortress after the defeat of the Moors at Las Navas
de Tolosa (1212). Bull-fights were formerly held in the main
<i>plaza</i>, where galleries to accommodate spectators were built
between the buttresses of an ancient parish church. Manzanares

<p><span class="bold">MANZANILLO,<a name="ar180" id="ar180"></a></span> a town and port on the Pacific coast of
Mexico, in the state of Colima, 52 m. by rail W.S.W. of the city
of that name. It is situated on a large harbour partly formed
and sheltered by a long island extending southwards parallel
with the coast. Southward also, and in the vicinity of the
town, is the large stagnant, shallow lagoon of Cayutlán which
renders the town unhealthy. Manzanillo is a commercial
town of comparatively recent creation. Its new harbour works,
the construction of which was begun in 1899, and its railway
connexion with central Mexico, promise to make it one of the
chief Pacific ports of the republic. These works include a
breakwater 1300 ft. long, with a depth of 12 to 70 ft. and a
maximum breadth of 320 ft. at the base and 25 ft. on top, and
all the necessary berthing and mechanical facilities for the
handling of cargoes. A narrow-gauge railway was built between
Colima and Manzanillo toward the end of the nineteenth century,
but the traffic was only sufficient for a tri-weekly service up
to 1908, when the gauge was widened and the railway became
part of the Mexican Central branch, completed in that year from
Irapuato through Guadalajara to Colima. The exports include
hides and skins, palm leaf hats, Indian corn, coffee, palm oil,

<p><span class="bold">MANZANILLO,<a name="ar181" id="ar181"></a></span> an important commercial city of Cuba, in
Santiago province, on the gulf of Guacanabo, about 17 m. S.
of the mouth of the Rio Cauto, on the shore of Manzanillo Bay.
Pop. (1907), 15,819. It is shut off to the east and south by the
Sierra Maestra. Besides the Cauto, the rivers Yara and Buey
are near the city. Manzanillo is the only coast town of importance
between Trinidad and Santiago. It exports large quantities of
sugar, hides, tobacco, and bees-wax; also some cedar and
mahogany. The history of the settlement begins in 1784,
but the port was already important at that time for a trade
in woods and fruits; French and English corsairs resorted
thither for shipbuilding woods. The settlement was sacked
by the French in 1792, and in the following year a fort was
built for its protection. In 1833 it received an <i>ayuntamiento</i>
(council) and in 1837, for its &ldquo;loyalty&rdquo; in not following the
lead of Santiago in proclaiming the Spanish Constitution,
received from the crown the title of <i>Fiel</i>. In 1827 the port
was opened to commerce, national and foreign.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MANZOLLI, PIER ANGELO,<a name="ar182" id="ar182"></a></span> Italian author, was born about
the end of the fifteenth century at La Stellata, near Ferrara.
He wrote a poem entitled <i>Zodiacus vitae</i>, published at Basel
in 1543, and dedicated to Hercules II. of Ferrara. The poem is
full of didactic writing on the subject of human happiness in
connexion with scientific knowledge, and combines metaphysical
speculation with satirical attacks on ecclesiastical hypocrisy,
and especially on the Pope and on Luther. It was translated
into several languages, but fell under the ban of the Inquisition
on the ground of its rationalizing tendencies.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MANZONI, ALESSANDRO FRANCESCO TOMMASO ANTONIO<a name="ar183" id="ar183"></a></span>
(1785-1873), Italian poet and novelist, was born at Milan
on the 7th of March 1785. Don Pietro, his father, then
about fifty, represented an old family settled near Lecco, but
originally feudal lords of Barzio, in the Valsassina, where
the memory of their violence is still perpetuated in a local
proverb, comparing it to that of the mountain torrent. The
poet&rsquo;s maternal grandfather, Cesare Beccaria, was a well-known
author, and his mother Giulia a woman of some literary ability.
Manzoni&rsquo;s intellect was slow in maturing, and at the various
colleges where his school days were passed he ranked among
the dunces. At fifteen, however, he developed a passion for
poetry, and wrote two sonnets of considerable merit. On the
death of his father in 1805, he joined his mother at Auteuil,
and spent two years there, mixing in the literary set of the
so-called &ldquo;ideologues,&rdquo; philosophers of the 18th century school,
among whom he made many friends, notably Claude Fauriel.
There too he imbibed the negative creed of Voltairianism, and
only after his marriage, and under the influence of his wife,
did he exchange it for that fervent Catholicism which coloured
his later life. In 1806-1807, while at Auteuil, he first appeared
before the public as a poet, with two pieces, one entitled <i>Urania</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page627" id="page627"></a>627</span>
in the classical style, of which he became later the most conspicuous
adversary, the other an elegy in blank verse, on the death
of Count Carlo Imbonati, from whom, through his mother, he
inherited considerable property, including the villa of Brusuglio,
thenceforward his principal residence.</p>

<p>Manzoni&rsquo;s marriage in 1808 to Henriette Blondel, daughter of
a Genevese banker, proved a most happy one, and he led for
many years a retired domestic life, divided between literature
and the picturesque husbandry of Lombardy. His intellectual
energy at this period was devoted to the composition of the
<i>Inni sacri</i>, a series of sacred lyrics, and a treatise on Catholic
morality, forming a task undertaken under religious guidance,
in reparation for his early lapse from faith. In 1818 he had
to sell his paternal inheritance, as his affairs had gone to ruin
in the hands of a dishonest agent. His characteristic generosity
was shown on this occasion in his dealings with his peasants,
who were heavily indebted to him. He not only cancelled
on the spot the record of all sums owing to him, but bade them
keep for themselves the whole of the coming maize harvest.</p>

<p>In 1819 Manzoni published his first tragedy, <i>Il Conte di Carmagnola</i>,
which, boldly violating all classical conventionalisms,
excited a lively controversy. It was severely criticized in the
<i>Quarterly Review</i>, in an article to which Goethe replied in its
defence, &ldquo;one genius,&rdquo; as Count de Gubernatis remarks, &ldquo;having
divined the other.&rdquo; The death of Napoleon in 1821 inspired
Manzoni&rsquo;s powerful stanzas <i>Il Cinque maggio</i>, the most popular
lyric in the Italian language. The political events of that year,
and the imprisonment of many of his friends, weighed much
on Manzoni&rsquo;s mind, and the historical studies in which he sought
distraction during his subsequent retirement at Brusuglio suggested
his great work. Round the episode of the <i>Innominato</i>,
historically identified with Bernardino Visconti, the novel
<i>I Promessi sposi</i> began to grow into shape, and was completed
in September 1822. The work when published, after
revision by friends in 1825-1827, at the rate of a volume a
year, at once raised its author to the first rank of literary
fame. In 1822, Manzoni published his second tragedy <i>Adelchi</i>,
turning on the overthrow by Charlemagne of the Lombard
domination in Italy, and containing many veiled allusions to
the existing Austrian rule. With these works Manzoni&rsquo;s
literary career was practically closed. But he laboriously
revised <i>I Promessi sposi</i> in the Tuscan idiom, and in 1840
republished it in that form, with a sort of sequel, <i>La
Storia della Colonna infame</i>, of very inferior interest. He also
wrote a small treatise on the Italian language.</p>

<p>The end of the poet&rsquo;s long life was saddened by domestic
sorrows. The loss of his wife in 1833 was followed by that
of several of his children, and of his mother. In 1837 he
married his second wife, Teresa Borri, widow of Count
Stampa, whom he also survived, while of nine children
born to him in his two marriages all but two preceded him
to the grave. The death of his eldest son, Pier Luigi, on
the 28th of April 1873, was the final blow which hastened
his end; he fell ill immediately, and died of cerebral meningitis,
on the 22nd of May. His country mourned him with almost
royal pomp, and his remains, after lying in state for some days,
were followed to the cemetery of Milan by a vast cortège,
including the royal princes and all the great officers of state.
But his noblest monument was Verdi&rsquo;s <i>Requiem</i>, specially
written to honour his memory.</p>

<p>Biographical sketches of Manzoni have been published by Cesare
Cantù (1885), Angelo de Gubernatis (1879), Arturo Graf (1898).
Some of his letters have been published by Giovanni Sforza (1882).</p>

<p><span class="bold">MAORI<a name="ar184" id="ar184"></a></span> (pronounced &ldquo;Mowri&rdquo;; a Polynesian word meaning
&ldquo;native,&rdquo; &ldquo;indigenous&rdquo;; the word occurs in distinction from
<i>pakeha</i>, &ldquo;stranger,&rdquo; in other parts of Polynesia in the forms
<i>Maoi</i> and <i>Maoli</i>), the name of the race inhabiting New Zealand
when first visited by Tasman in 1642.</p>

<p>That they were not indigenous, but had displaced an earlier
Melanesian or Papuan race, the true aborigines, is certain. The
Maoris are Polynesians, and, in common with the majority of
their kinsfolk throughout the Pacific, they have traditions which
point to Savaii, originally Savaiki, the largest island of the
Samoan group, as their cradleland. They say they came to
New Zealand from &ldquo;Hawaiki,&rdquo; and they appear to distinguish
between a large and small, or a nearer and farther, &ldquo;Hawaiki.&rdquo;
&ldquo;The seed of our coming is from Hawaiki; the seed of our nourishing,
the seed of mankind.&rdquo; Their great chief, Te Kupe, first
landed, they say, on Aotearoa, as they called the north island,
and, pleased with his discovery, returned to Hawaiki to tell his
fellow-countrymen. Thereafter he returned with seven war
canoes, each holding a hundred warriors, priests, stone idols and
sacred weapons, as well as native plants and animals. Hawaiki,
the name of Te Kupe&rsquo;s traditional home, is identical with several
other Polynesian place-names, <i>e.g.</i> Hawaii, Apai in the Tonga
Islands, Evava in the Marquesas, all of which are held to be
derived from Savii or Savaiki. Dr Thomson, in his <i>Story of New
Zealand</i>, quotes a Maori tradition, published by Sir George Grey,
that certain islands, among which it names Rarotonga, Parima
and Manono, are islands near Hawaiki. The Rarotongas call
themselves Maori, and state that their ancestors came from
Hawaiki, and <span class="correction" title="amended from Pirima">Parima</span> and Manono are the native names of two
islands in the Samoan group. The almost identical languages
of the Rarotongas and the Maoris strengthen the theory that
the two peoples are descended from Polynesians migrating,
possibly at widely different dates, from Samoa. The distance
from Rarotonga to New Zealand is about 2000 m., and, with the
aid of the trade wind, large canoes could traverse the distance
within a month. Moreover the fauna and flora of New Zealand
in many ways resemble those of Samoa. Thus it would seem
certain that the Maoris, starting from &ldquo;further Hawaiki,&rdquo;
or Samoa, first touched at Rarotonga, &ldquo;nearer Hawaiki,&rdquo; whence,
after forming a settlement, they journeyed on to New Zealand.
Maori tradition is explicit as to the cause of the exodus from
Samoa, gives the names of the canoes in which the journey was
made and the time of year at which the coast of New Zealand
was sighted. On the question of the date a comparison of
genealogies of Maori chiefs shows that, up to the beginning of
the 20th century, about eighteen generations or probably not
much more than five centuries had passed since the first Maori
arrivals. There is some evidence that the &ldquo;tradition of the six
canoes&rdquo; does not represent the first contact of the Polynesian
race with New Zealand. If earlier immigrants from Samoa or
other eastern Pacific islands arrived they must have become
absorbed into the native Papuan population&mdash;arguing from
the absence of any distinct tradition earlier than that &ldquo;of the
six canoes.&rdquo; Some have sought to find in the Morioris of
Chatham Island the remnants of this Papuan-Polynesian
population, expelled by Te Kupe and his followers. The
extraordinary ruined fortifications found, and the knowledge
of the higher art of war displayed by the Maoris,
suggest (what is no doubt the fact) that there was a hard
fight for them when they first arrived, but the greatest
resistance must have been from the purer Papuan inhabitants,
and not from the half-castes who were probably easily overwhelmed.
The shell heaps found on the coasts and elsewhere
dispose of the theory that New Zealand was uninhabited or
practically so six centuries back.</p>

<p>Any description of the Maoris, who in recent years have come
more and more under the influence of white civilization, must
necessarily refer rather to what they have been than what they
are. Physically the Maoris are true Polynesians, tall, well-built,
with straight or slightly curved noses, high foreheads and oval
faces. Their colour is usually a darker brown than that of their
kinsfolk of the eastern Pacific, but light-complexioned Maoris,
almost European in features, are met with. Their hair is black
and straight or wavy, scarcely ever curly. They have long been
celebrated for their tattooing, the designs being most elaborate.</p>

<p>Among the most industrious of Polynesian races, they have
always been famed for wood-carving; and in building, weaving
and dyeing they had made great advances before the whites
arrived. They are also good farmers and bold seamen. In the
Maori wars they showed much strategic skill, and their knowledge
of fortification was very remarkable. Politically the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page628" id="page628"></a>628</span>
Maoris have always been democratic. No approach to a monarchy
ever existed. Each tribe under its chief was autonomous.
Tribal lands were held in common and each man was entitled
to a share in the products. They had slaves, but so few as not
to alter the social conditions. Every Maori was a soldier, and
war was the chief business and joy of his life. Tribal wars were
incessant. The weapons were wooden spears, clubs and stone
tomahawks. Cannibalism, which earned them in earlier years
a terrible name, was generally restricted to the bloodthirsty
banquets which always followed a victory. The Maoris ate
their enemies&rsquo; hearts to gain their courage, but to whatever
degree animistic beliefs may have once contributed to their
cannibalism, it is certain that long before Captain Cook&rsquo;s visit
religious sanction for the custom had long given place to mere
gluttonous enjoyment.</p>

<p>The Maoris had no regular marriage ceremony. Polygamy
was universal, and even to-day they are not strictly monogamous.
The power of the husband over the wife was absolute, but women
took their meals with the men, were allowed a voice in the tribe&rsquo;s
affairs, and sometimes accompanied the men into battle. Some
tribes were endogamic, and there matriarchy was the rule,
descent being traced through the female line. Ferocious as they
were in war, the Maoris are generally hospitable and affectionate
in their home-life, and a pleasant characteristic, noticed by
Captain Cook, is their respect and care of the old. The Maoris
buried their dead, the cemeteries being ornamented with carved
posts. Their religion was a nature-worship intimately connected
with the veneration of ancestors. There was a belief
in the soul, which was supposed to dwell in the left eye. They
had no doubt as to a future state, but no definite idea of a
supreme being. They had no places of worship, nor, though
they had sacred wooden figures, is there any reason to consider
that they were idolaters in the strict sense of the word. The
custom of taboo was very fully developed. Nowadays they
are all nominally Christians. While they had no written
language, a considerable oral literature of songs, legends and
traditions existed. Their priesthood was a highly trained
profession, and they had schools which taught a knowledge of
the stars and constellations, for many of which they had names.
All Maoris are natural orators and poets, and a chief was expected
to add these accomplishments to his prowess as a warrior or
his skill as a seaman. The Maoris of to-day are law-abiding,
peaceable and indolent. They have been called the Britons of
the south, and their courage in defending their country and
their intelligence amply justify the compliment. By the New
Zealanders they are cordially liked. At the census of 1906 they
numbered 47,731, as against 45,470 in 1874; and there were
6516 half-castes. See also <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Polynesia</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Samoa</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">MAP<a name="ar185" id="ar185"></a></span> (or <span class="sc">Mapes</span>), <span class="bold">WALTER</span> (d. <i>c.</i> 1208/9), medieval ecclesiastic,
author and wit, to whose authority the main body of prose
Arthurian literature has, at one time or another, been assigned,
flourished in the latter part of the 12th and early years of the
13th centuries. Concerning the date of his birth and his parentage
nothing definite is known, but as he ascribes his position
at court to the merits of his parents they were probably people
of some importance. He studied at Paris under Girard la
Pucelle, who began to teach in or about 1160, but as he states
in his book <i>De nugis curialium</i> that he was at the court of
Henry II. before 1162, his residence at Paris must have been
practically comprised in the decade 1150-1160.</p>

<p>Map&rsquo;s career was an active and varied one; he was clerk of the
royal household and justice itinerant; in 1179 he was present at
the Lateran council at Rome, on his way thither being entertained
by the count of Champagne; at this time he apparently
held a plurality of ecclesiastical benefices, being a prebend of
St Paul&rsquo;s, canon and precentor of Lincoln and parson of Westbury,
Gloucestershire. There seems to be no record of his ordination,
but as he was a candidate for the see of Hereford in 1199 it is
most probable that he was in priest&rsquo;s orders. The last reference
to him, as living, is in 1208, when an order for payment to him
is on record, but Giraldus Cambrensis, in the second edition of
his <i>Hibernica</i>, redacted in 1210, utters a prayer for his soul,
&ldquo;cujus animae propitietur Deus,&rdquo; a proof that he was no longer
alive.</p>

<p>The special interest of Map lies in the perplexing question of
his relation to the Arthurian legend and literature. He is invariably
cited as the author of the <i>Lancelot</i> proper (consisting
of two parts), the <i>Queste</i> and the <i>Mort Artus</i>, all three of which
are now generally found in one manuscript under the title of
<i>Lancelot</i>. The <i>Mort Artus</i>, however, we know to be the prose
working over of an earlier and independent poem. Sundry
manuscripts of the yet more extensive compilation which begins
with the <i>Grand Saint Graal</i> also refer to Map as having composed
the cycle in conjunction with Robert de Borron, to whom, as a
rule, the <i>Grand Saint Graal</i> and <i>Merlin</i> are exclusively assigned.
The curious <i>Merlin</i> text, Bibl. Nat. 337 (fonds Français), refers
throughout to Map as authority; and the enormous <i>Lancelot</i>
codex, B. N. 112, a combination of the <i>Lancelot</i> and the <i>Tristan</i>,
also couples his name with that of Robert de Borron. In fact
it may safely be said that, with the exception of the prose <i>Tristan</i>,
always attributed either to Luces de Gast, or Hélie de Borron,
the authority of Map has been invoked for the entire vast mass
of Arthurian prose romantic literature. Now it is practically
impossible that one man, and that one an occupier of court and
public offices, constantly employed in royal and public business,
very frequently travelling abroad (<i>e.g.</i> we know he was at
Limoges in 1173; at Rome in 1179; in Anjou in 1183; and
at Angers in 1199), could have found the necessary leisure.
On this point we have the testimony of his one undoubted
work, <i>De nugis curialium</i>, which he tells us he composed &ldquo;by
snatches&rdquo; during his residence at court. <i>De nugis</i> is a
comparatively small book; if it were difficult to find leisure for
that, much more would it have been difficult to find the time
requisite for the composition of one only of the many long-winded
romances which have been fathered on Map. Giraldus Cambrensis,
with whom he was on most friendly terms, and who
frequently refers to and quotes him, records a speech in which
Map contrasted Giraldus&rsquo; labours with his own, apparently to the
disadvantage of the latter, &ldquo;vos scripta dedistis, et nos verba&rdquo;&mdash;a
phrase which has been interpreted as meaning that Map
himself had produced no literary work. But inasmuch as the
<i>De nugis</i> is undoubtedly, and certain satirical poems directed
against the loose life of the clergy of the day most probably, his
work, the speech must not be taken too literally. It seems
difficult also to believe that Map&rsquo;s name should be so constantly
connected with our Arthurian tradition without any ground
whatever; though it must be admitted that he himself never
makes any such claim&mdash;the references in the romances are all
couched in the third person, and bear no sign of being other than
the record by the copyist of a traditional attribution.</p>

<p>A different and very interesting piece of evidence is afforded
by the <i>Ipomedon</i> of Hue de Rotelande; in relating how his hero
appeared at a tournament three days running, in three different
suits of armour, red, black and white, the author remarks,</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p><i>Sul ne sai pas de mentir l&rsquo;art</i></p>
<p><i>Walter Map reset ben sa part.</i></p>
</div> </td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">This apparently indicated that Map, also, had made himself
responsible for a similar story. Now this incident of the &ldquo;Three
Days&rsquo; Tournament&rdquo; is found alike in the prose <i>Lancelot</i> and in
the German <i>Lanzelet</i>, this latter translated from a French poem
which, in 1194, was in the possession of Hugo de Morville. The
<i>Ipomedon</i> was written somewhere in the decade 1180-1190, and
there is no evidence of the prose romance having then been in
existence. We have no manuscript of any prose Arthurian
romance earlier than the 13th century, to which period Gaston
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page629" id="page629"></a>629</span>
Paris assigned them; they are certainly posterior to the verse
romances. Chrétien de Troyes, in his <i>Cligés</i> (the date of which
falls somewhere in the decade 1160-1170), knew and utilized
the story of the &ldquo;Three Days&rsquo; Tournament,&rdquo; and moreover
makes Lancelot take part in it. Map was, as we have seen,
frequently in France; Chrétien had for patroness Marie, countess
of Champagne, step-daughter to Henry II., Map&rsquo;s patron; Map&rsquo;s
position was distinctly superior to that of Chrétien. Taking all
the evidence into consideration it seems more probable that Map
had, at a comparatively early date, before he became so important
an official, composed a poem on the subject of Lancelot,
which was the direct source of the German version, and which
Chrétien also knew and followed.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The form in which certain of the references to him are couched
favours the above view; the compiler of <i>Guiron le Cortois</i> says in his
prologue that &ldquo;<i>maistre Gautier Map qui fu clers au roi Henry&mdash;devisa
cil l&rsquo;estoire de monseigneur Lancelot du Lac, que d&rsquo;autre chose
ne parla il mie gramment en son livre</i>&rdquo;; and in another place he
refers to Map, &ldquo;<i>qui fit lou propre livre de monsoingnour Lancelot dou
Lac</i>.&rdquo; Now only during the early part of his career could Map fairly
be referred to as simple &ldquo;<i>clers au roi Henry</i>,&rdquo; and both extracts
emphasize the fact that his work dealt, almost exclusively, with
Lancelot. Neither of these passages would fit the prose romance,
as we know it, but both might well suit the lost French source of the
<i>Lanzelet</i>; where we are in a position to compare the German versions
of French romances with their originals we find, as a rule, that the
translators have followed their source faithfully.</p>

<p>One of the references to Map&rsquo;s works in the <i>Merlin</i> manuscript
above referred to (B.N. 337) has an interesting touch not found elsewhere.
After saying how Map translated the romance from the
Latin at the bidding of King Henry, the usual statement, the scribe
adds &ldquo;<i>qui riche loier l&rsquo;en dona</i>.&rdquo; It is of course possible that Map&rsquo;s
rise at court may have been due to his having hit the literary taste
of the monarch, who, we know, was interested in the Arthurian tradition,
but it must be admitted that direct evidence on the subject
is practically nil, and that in the present condition of our knowledge
we can only advance possible hypotheses.</p>

<i>Latin Poems attributed to Map</i> have been edited for the Camden
Society by T. Wright (1841). For discussion of his authorship of the
<i>Lancelot</i> cf. <i>The Three Days&rsquo; Tournament</i>, Grimm Library XV.
